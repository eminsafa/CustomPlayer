1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,877
previously on ''prison Break'':

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,279
I didn't kiII that man.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,555
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,192
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,670
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison ceII.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,389
- I'm Iooking for LincoIn Burrows.
- Man kiIIed the VP's brother.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,914
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,194
I'II get you out of here.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,669
- It's impossibIe.
- Not if you designed the pIace.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,558
- You've seen the bIueprints.
- Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,313
- Find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,594
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,070
- There's a Iawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendabIe.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,756
You come around these bIeachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,593
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,879
- Where is Fibonacci?
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,353
(laughter)

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,874
Yeah!

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,236
Oh, my God! WiIIiamson, get in here!

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,749
- What the heII happened in here?
- An accident.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,718
Let me get in here. HoId on. Come on.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,711
Get out.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,910
I thought you said you were
gonna have a conversation with him.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,309
Yeah, I did.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,790
Things... escaIated.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,354
We need some heIp here.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,797
Bring him on into three.
Kathy, I'm gonna need 10ccs of XyIocaine.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,031
Thanks, guys. I'II take it from here.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,351
I said thank you. I'II take it from here.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,271
Let's go.

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,320
OK, Iet's take a Iook at you.

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,030
You're OK. You're OK.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,480
(sobs)

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,557
- What happened?
- Nothing.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,712
This isn't nothing.
I need you to teII me what happened.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,678
Don't make me Iie to you.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,395
PIease.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,038
AII right, you guys?

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,588
- Yeah, no probIem.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,237
IA shouId start an investigation.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,118
Oh, there's no need. We know what happened.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,111
Perhaps you'd enIighten me.

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,035
There was a pair of gardening shears Ieft
on the fIoor of the shed. He stepped on them.

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,793
- The bIade went right through his boot, huh?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,156
So why wasn't the boot stiII on his foot?

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,356
Like I said, Doc,

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,000
we got it taken care of.

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,071
Let's go.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
(pained groan)

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,038
- I'II kiII that scum.
- You kiII him, you kiII our ticket out of here.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,910
Look what he did to you. You won't Iast
a second here unIess I do something about it.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,878
- You ever hear of Top FIight Charters?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,715
They operate fIights from smaII airfieIds
in the Midwest, Iike the one ten miIes away.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,268
They're run by a sheII corporation
Abruzzi owns.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,399
We get him on board, there'II be
a fIight for us the night we get outside.

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,995
You're wiIIing to risk the entire escape
on a guy you don't know?

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,949
Preparation can onIy take you so far.
After that, you gotta take a few Ieaps of faith.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,595
- Abruzzi's a huge Ieap of faith.
- I'm not taIking about Abruzzi.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,470
There's someone eIse who hoIds the key
to this thing. It either works or it doesn't.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,473
ProbIem is, I couIdn't know
who that was untiI he got in here.

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,354
Sucre? You can't be serious.

62
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,318
The guy's a thief, MichaeI. He can't be trusted.

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,598
Gonna have to trust him,
because he's my ceIImate.

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,150
- How weII do you know him?
- About as weII as a man can in a week.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,916
You teII him, he teIIs everyone, we're done.
You know that, right?

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,596
If he's not on board, there's no digging
in that ceII, and if there's no digging,

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,636
then there's no escape.

68
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,591
(phone rings out)

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,479
(answerphone) Thank you for calling.
please leave a message after the tone.

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,075
Maricruz. It's me, baby. Are you there?

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,550
Pick up if you're there, Mari.
I've been in the SHU.

72
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,154
I've been thinking about you.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,479
About your body.
God, I've been thinking about your body.

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,677
- (woman) Hello?
- Mrs DeIgado...

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,752
Hi, how you doing? It's me, Fernando.

76
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,199
Sorry to bother you at home. Do you know
what's up with Maricruz's ceIIphone?

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,070
- Itjust keeps going straight to voice maiI.
- Maybe she has it turned off.

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,358
- Any chance you know where she is?
- I know exactIy where she is.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,271
- And that wouId be?
- With Hector.

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,319
- Hector?
- That's right. They're at the maII, I think.

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,678
I don't suppose next time you see her
you couId have her turn her phone back on?

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,470
Mrs DeIgado, I know you don't Iike me,
but I Iove your daughter and she Ioves me.

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,516
We're gonna get married, you know?

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,831
If you were a decent man,
and you reaIIy Ioved her,

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,514
you'd Iet her Iive her Iife.

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,830
What's that supposed to mean?

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,354
I'II teII her you caIIed.

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,749
- I'm Iooking to do some damage.
- WeII, you've come to the right pIace.

89
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,308
I want to do it sIow.

90
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,598
InfIict the maximum amount of pain
so a guy wishes he'd die, and get it over with,

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,035
butjust can't quite get there.

92
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,395
Oh, I got that.

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,555
I got that.

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,593
Look at this right here, boss.

95
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,835
I caII it the gutter.

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,957
You jam it in the stomach.
These bits hook the intestines.

97
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,592
You give it a puII back, poor sucker's guts
are hanging right out of his stomach,

98
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,753
and he'II get a reaI good Iook at 'em
cos the wound's not fataI.

99
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,752
At Ieast not untiI the infection sets in.

100
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,435
(whispers) You're one sick puppy,
you know that?

101
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,553
Thank you.

102
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,990
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,357
They've gotten to you, haven't they?
The other prisoners.

104
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,749
My God, MichaeI, this pIace is gonna kiII you.

105
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,355
You said you taIked to a woman.
What was her name?

106
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,431
- Leticia.
- Leticia Barris.

107
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,354
- How'd you know?
- A year ago I was doing what you're doing -

108
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,635
trying to find out the truth.

109
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,756
It's a bottomIess pit, Veronica.

110
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,152
They designed it so that when you
got to the bottom of it LincoIn wouId be dead.

111
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,878
Why didn't you teII me?

112
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,672
Once the day was set, once that finaI appeaI
had been rejected, he had 60 days to Iive.

113
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,118
I figured I couId pIay their game and watch
him die, or take matters into my own hands.

114
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,270
You don't have to do that.

115
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,717
Leticia knows something. If I can get it
out of her, maybe we can reopen the case.

116
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,153
What'd she say?

117
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,676
Somebody eIse was behind
the kiIIing of the vice president's brother.

118
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,389
- Who?
- She took off before I got anything out of her.

119
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,232
(bell)

120
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,471
She's hoIed up in the EIysian FieIds project.
I'II go see her.

121
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,518
That pIace is dangerous.
Take someone with you.

122
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,592
- Who?
- Fianc¨¦'d be a good pIace to start.

123
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,196
I think that's probabIy the Iast thing
in the worId Sebastian wouId ever want to do.

124
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,078
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

125
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,238
No priors, a good student.

126
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,596
Then you get yourseIf arrested
for intent to seII.

127
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,629
- Good Iife get a IittIe boring?
- It was stupid. It won't happen again.

128
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,188
WeII, we're aII here to make sure of that.

129
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,113
I spoke to your mother before you came in.

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,590
She toId me that there were
some extenuating circumstances...

131
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,116
If you mean that guy at Fox River,
he's got nothing to do with this.

132
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,239
- He refuses to caII him his father.
- The worId wouId be better without him.

133
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,118
It's cIear to me
you've got a Iot of anger, young man.

134
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,237
Misdirected,
it couId Iand you in the wrong pIace.

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,949
To make sure that doesn't happen,
you'II check in with me once a week.

136
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,190
Fridays. One hour.

137
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,636
- Your grades need to be pristine.
- AbsoIuteIy.

138
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,395
To give you an idea where
that anger wiII get you if you don't rein it in,

139
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,278
I'II sign you up
for the programme at Fox River.

140
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,239
You'II have a mentor who you'II work with.
Give you some perspective.

141
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,470
A mentor?

142
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,551
Your father.

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,477
(man) Let's go. Pick up the pace.

144
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,556
This ain't the Sistine ChapeI, guys. Just
roII it up and down, move on to the next one.

145
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,474
TeII me that ain't what I think it is.

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,437
It ain't what you think it is.

147
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,672
Fish, a ceIIphone in here?
That's cardinaI sin number one.

148
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,635
- They can tack two years onto your bid.
- If they catch you.

149
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,234
You know what troubIe
I can get for knowing this?

150
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,914
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

151
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,194
Now, that means you can make caIIs
whenever you want, right?

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,838
I don't Iike the Iook in your eye.
What's in there, you never saw it. Got it?

153
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,236
Why didn't you incIude any names?

154
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,788
Why wouId I want anyone to watch me die?

155
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,190
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

156
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,515
Some peopIe want to go it aIone, others have
grandiose statements they want to make,

157
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,116
but most want
some member of their famiIy there

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,919
before they Ieave this worId.

159
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,437
I'II do it aIone.

160
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,239
Son, in my opinion,

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,716
aII inmates who have made that choice
have deepIy regretted it in their finaI minutes.

162
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,511
I'II...

163
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,516
Ieave it bIank for now.

164
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,591
You have Iess than four weeks now.

165
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,433
You shouId give it some thought.

166
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,914
(hip-hop music plays)

167
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
Hi, I'm Iooking for Leticia Barris.

168
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,869
- Five.
- Thank you.

169
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,073
HeIIo?

170
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,193
Don't you move a muscIe.

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,551
Take it easy, Leticia.

172
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,677
You're working with 'em.
You think I'm stupid, Iady?

173
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,718
I hear the cIicks on my phone,
I see the cars on the street.

174
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,837
I know you're scared. I am too.

175
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,309
But, pIease, put the gun down.

176
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,709
Where you going?

177
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,916
IreIand. What difference does it make?

178
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,389
AII the difference.
Nobody got your testimony.

179
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,948
That's the reason I'm stiII breathing.

180
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,874
- I'm not with them. You have to beIieve me.
- What you sneaking in here for?

181
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,838
- I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,718
Why do you care
about my weIIbeing aII of a sudden?

183
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,712
- I don't.
- FinaIIy, an honest answer.

184
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,314
But maybe you can save LincoIn.

185
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,518
And maybe you can bring down the guys
who kiIIed your boyfriend in the process.

186
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,799
If someone kiIIed you and Crab couId've done
something to them, you think he wouId have?

187
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,395
I'm not as strong as he was.
I can't take those peopIe on.

188
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,675
I'II take them on.

189
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,196
AII you have to do is come to my office
and teII me what you know.

190
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,670
I'II type it up,
you can sign the affidavit and spIit.

191
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,354
I'II take you to the airport myseIf.

192
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,029
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

193
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,669
Yllam¨¢ndolo. Bua. Ylo meto en el bolsillo.

194
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,478
T¨± sabes?

195
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,311
BeIIick.

196
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,072
Hey, what's up, LincoIn?

197
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,080
I want extra time outside
for the next two weeks.

198
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,958
Paint fumes in PI must be getting to you.

199
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,395
CeIIphones aIIowed in here?

200
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,119
Who?

201
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,829
Extra time outside, coupIe cigarettes.

202
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,832
HaIf-hour one week. One cigarette.

203
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,593
Know a con named Sucre?

204
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,194
This is what I don't understand, John.

205
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,635
Otto Fibonacci fingers you.

206
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,590
He put you in prison for Iife, yet you act Iike
you don't even want to find out where he is.

207
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,671
That's not true, PhiIIy.

208
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,834
Maybe you don't think you have anything
to Iose any more. You're aIready Iocked up.

209
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,151
Maybe you Iike it here. I don't know.

210
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,233
But what I do know
is that if Fibonacci testifies next month,

211
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,470
you and I are gonna be neighbours.

212
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,869
And I am not going to Iet that happen.

213
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,873
I don't think you wouId fit in here, PhiIIy.

214
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,598
Fancy suits and ties and shirts.

215
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,953
I think you're right, so Iet's cut to the chase.

216
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,830
Did you break this kid?
Did he teII you where Fibonacci is?

217
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,553
- What is this?
- It's a IittIe gift from me to you.

218
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,639
- Are these his?
- Yeah. He won't crack.

219
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,996
WeII, perhaps you shouId consider
using a different methodoIogy then, John.

220
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,835
From what I gather, there are far worse
threats in prison other than bodiIy harm.

221
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,477
What happened to the days
when you used to trust me, PhiIIy,

222
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,437
that I wouId get things done?

223
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,159
That was when you actuaIIy
did get things done.

224
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,913
(buzzer)

225
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,397
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy! Daddy!

226
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,311
Did you hear the news?

227
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,994
What... what news?

228
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,038
We're going to stay
with UncIe PhiIIy at the Iake.

229
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,590
Yeah, and we're gonna have a good time.

230
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,069
You're right, John. Maybe you're right.

231
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,276
I do trust you.

232
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,194
Now, you're gonna
take care of that thing, aren't you?

233
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,676
How are those bone-yard visits
going with that girIfriend of yours?

234
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,354
I imagine pretty good, huh?

235
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,955
You know, visitation ruIes stipuIate
that conjugaIs are onIy for married coupIes.

236
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,434
We're engaged. Besides, I got that coming
to me cos I ain't caused no static in this pIace.

237
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,069
PIease, don't dead my conjugaIs.

238
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,469
I won't.

239
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,232
Thank you.

240
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,236
But in exchange,
you have to teII me where that ceIIphone is.

241
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,514
CeIIphone?

242
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,991
Don't pIay stupid with me. I'm giving you
a chance to save your precious conjugaIs.

243
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,870
You Iie to me, they're gone
and they're never coming back.

244
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,948
Where's that ceIIphone?

245
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,833
Turner, your transfer came in.
They want you in administration.

246
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,590
He didn't taIk.

247
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,510
AII I got to say is I better get
to make aII the caIIs I want.

248
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,714
Gonna be kinda hard.

249
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,594
Soap?

250
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,235
I Iost my conjugaIs over soap?

251
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,632
You may have Iost your conjugaIs, but
I can do you one better. I can get you to her.

252
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,553
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

253
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,870
Yeah? How you gonna do that?

254
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,753
We're breaking out of here.

255
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,512
How?

256
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,637
- Starts in our ceII.
- In our ceII?

257
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,673
- To teII you the truth, it's aIready started.
- Ah.

258
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,873
Are you crazy?
You think I want to break out of here?

259
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,791
16 months from now I'm at the gate.

260
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,031
I'm getting married,
and not with no posse on my ass.

261
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,236
I oughta beat you six ways tiII Sunday.

262
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,153
I Iost my conjugaIs
because of your IittIe bar of soap.

263
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,356
I had to see if you couId keep a secret.

264
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,193
You want a secret? I got a secret for you, fish.

265
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,637
You dig in my ceII when I'm there,
and I'm gonna spIit your wig.

266
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,518
T¨± me est¨¢s entendiendo?

267
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,674
That went weII.

268
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,917
Let's start with LincoIn's reIationship
with your boyfriend.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,198
He owed my man 90,000. He wasn't getting
it done. AII of a sudden, it gets done.

270
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,669
Crab waIks up with 90k and a big-ass smiIe.

271
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,433
- Who paid him?
- Not LincoIn. They paid his marker.

272
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,114
Who's they?

273
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,671
It's aII right, Leticia.
I toId you, you're safe here.

274
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,838
Crab brought this guy home.
Never seen him before.

275
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,153
Crab did what he aIways did. He toId me
to take a waIk, so that's exactIy what I did.

276
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,074
There was something about this guy.
He wasn't the kind he usuaIIy deaIt with.

277
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,229
What do you mean?

278
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,915
CouIdn't put my finger on it
tiII he went outside. Then I knew.

279
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,639
- He had that Iook.
- What Iook?

280
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,076
(Leticia) Like they own the pIace,
Iike they're untouchabIe,

281
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,071
Iike they're government.

282
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,516
(Veronica)
So the government paid LincoIn's debt?

283
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,037
- Did Crab say what they wanted in return?
- Uh-uh.

284
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,398
AII right. Just give me
a moment to type this up.

285
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,996
- Where are you going?
- To have a smoke.

286
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,232
- This is onIy gonna take me a minute.
- So wiII the smoke.

287
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,439
No sweIIing, so there's no sign of infection.
I'II keep you on antibiotics for ten days.

288
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,476
You shouId be good.

289
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,797
You understand by Iaw I must fiIe a report
if I feeI there has been prisoner misconduct?

290
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,998
There's no way this injury happened
by stepping on a bIade in a garden shed.

291
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,072
If you fiIe the report,
things couId get a Iot worse.

292
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,199
- They're not aIready?
- Not compared to what they couId be.

293
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,519
- I've made some enemies.
- Yeah.

294
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,670
You scared?

295
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,794
Men. OK.

296
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,872
Here's what I think. I think you are scared.

297
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,750
And you wouIdn't be human
if you weren't scared in a pIace Iike this.

298
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,593
When I was young, I couIdn't sIeep at night,

299
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,911
because I thought
there was a monster in the cIoset,

300
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,073
but my brother toId me
there wasn't anything in the cIoset but fear,

301
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,594
and fear wasn't reaI.

302
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,559
He said it wasn't made of anything.
It was just... air.

303
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,959
Not even that. He said you just have to face it.

304
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,589
You just have to open that door,
and the monster wouId disappear.

305
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,958
- Your brother sounds Iike a smart man.
- He is.

306
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,515
In here, though,
you face your fear, you open that door,

307
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,876
and there's a hundred more doors behind it.

308
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,193
And the monsters
that are hiding behind them are aII reaI.

309
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,953
If you want,
I couId recommend you be sent to ad seg.

310
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,198
With the rape victims and the snitches.

311
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,840
It wouId keep you safe.

312
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,630
Thanks, but I think I'd Iike
to face the monsters on my own.

313
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,518
Have a good smoke?

314
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,795
(Kellerman) I don't smoke.

315
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,590
Didn't mean to startIe you.

316
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,309
SpeciaI Agent KeIIerman, Secret Service.

317
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,313
We've been informed that you obtained
a copy of the surveiIIance tape

318
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,994
entered as evidence in the Burrows triaI.

319
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,072
- Is there a probIem with that?
- We're just foIIowing up.

320
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,110
Has there been an amendment to the Freedom
of Information Act that I'm not aware of?

321
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,796
When a prisoner gets near the end of his time
on death row, there's a Iot of Iast-minute...

322
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,714
I don't understand why this wouId
be a probIem for the Secret Service.

323
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,032
It's not. The prosecution made its case
far beyond any reasonabIe doubt

324
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,998
and we know that we have the right man.

325
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,516
That being said, if you come across anything

326
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,151
that couId shed some Iight on his innocence,
I'm offering my heIp.

327
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,630
Sounds great.
I reaIIy appreciate you coming by.

328
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,916
- Do you have a card, Agent KeIIerman?
- Of course.

329
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,916
Don't hesitate to caII.

330
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,877
Thanks.

331
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,189
Leticia.

332
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,395
(tyres screech)

333
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,357
(phone rings)

334
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,634
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry.
- Where are you?

335
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,032
- This isn't the time. I'm sorry.
- This is the time. I'm at the reception haII.

336
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,112
The coordinator's here, the vendors.

337
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,318
Look, I-I'm just...
I'm sorry. I-I can't taIk right now.

338
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,709
I say we take his whoIe foot.

339
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,554
(Abruzzi) We couId cut off aII his Iimbs.
He stiII wouIdn't taIk.

340
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,590
Pain is not the answer here.

341
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,150
Maybe the BeatIes were right after aII.

342
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,232
Maybe aII you need is Iove.

343
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,748
- What are you doing?
- What does it Iook Iike? I'm roIIing it up.

344
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,877
- You can't do this.
- I'm done with your reindeer games.

345
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,191
I'm gonna transfer to a nice,
quiet ceII with a normaI ceIIie,

346
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,475
one that doesn't screw my entire Iife up.

347
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,348
(low voice) Look, I'm sorry
about your conjugaIs,

348
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,671
but if you go now...

349
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,752
- Don't do this. PIease.
- Listen to me, fish.

350
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,116
I got 16 months. I got a fianc¨¦e to think about.

351
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,320
I get caught with a hoIe in my waII, I don't
get to see the worId for another five years.

352
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,709
Let's go, Sucre.

353
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,475
- I can't do that.
- There is a soIution. We can work it out.

354
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,832
Sorry, fish.

355
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,079
Can I ask you something?

356
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,199
Why have you denied any famiIy
or Ioved ones to be there for you in the end?

357
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
Why wouId I Iet them watch me die?

358
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,956
I've caused them enough pain.

359
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,712
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

360
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,360
Maybe it's about me watching them Iive.

361
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,318
- That the finaI torture?
- No.

362
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,233
It's about how you want to Ieave this worId.

363
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,232
What's the Iast image
you want to take with you?

364
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
A stranger?

365
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,918
Got an issue with our IittIe friend over there?

366
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,468
You don't give the green Iight.

367
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,233
Everything in here runs through me.
You know that.

368
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,393
May Tag's in the ground
because of that piece of detritus.

369
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,996
- So now you want him.
- Every day for the rest of his bid.

370
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,553
Seems you and I
have something in common, then.

371
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,992
Get in!

372
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,718
Easy, now, fish. Don't make this
any harder than it needs to be.

373
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,510
It's time we came to an arrangement,
don't you think?

374
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,078
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you
bow to stern as soon as I Iaid eyes on you,

375
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,632
but, aIackaday, you Iook so pretty
when you're scared, don't you?

376
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,349
Maybe we oughta get the Iove out of the way
before the hate. What do you say, pretty?

377
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,470
Yeah. Yeah, maybe it's time
I Iit up that Ieather once and for aII, huh?

378
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,075
God, he taIks too much.

379
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,232
You and I need to have a conversation.

380
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,073
What happened in there
was my way of saying

381
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,597
I know I've been going about
this whoIe thing the wrong way.

382
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,591
(man) We've got a man down!

383
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,513
- I'm trying to make amends.
- (man) We need some heIp.

384
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,989
- Bygones be bygones.
- (man) We need a doctor.

385
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,433
- You're a mercuriaI man, John.
- I prefer boId.

386
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,796
(man #2) Come on,
just keep it moving, guys. Come on!

387
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,117
- (Abruzzi) TeII me what you need from me.
- A trade.

388
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,670
You get me a pIane, and I'II get you Fibonacci.

389
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,594
- (Abruzzi) What do you need a pIane for?
- (Michael) I think you know.

390
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,038
(Abruzzi) I heIp you, I'm in.
You know that, don't you?

391
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,872
I do.

392
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,315
- Just gotta know the exact date and time.
- I'II teII you soon enough.

393
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,757
Soon enough won't cut it. I need
to be outside before Fibonacci testifies.

394
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,398
You wiII be.

395
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,871
- He testifies in one month.
- Then you'II be out in pIenty of time.

396
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,350
If not, you're a corpse.

397
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,192
So cut the crap. TeII me the exact date and
time so I can start making the arrangements.

398
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,714
- I don't know if I can trust you yet.
- Why not?

399
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,997
Like I said, John, you're a mercuriaI man.

400
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,438
- Lewis, take these off.
- Sink, I can't do that.

401
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,115
Come on, man. I'm in a cage. Ten minutes.

402
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,395
PIease.

403
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,675
It's my kid.

404
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,158
(awkwardly) So, here we are.

405
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,276
Yeah.

406
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,480
- How you been?
- You know, in troubIe.

407
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,596
How's your mom?

408
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,318
- She's good.
- Hey, um...

409
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,748
I've been taIking to the chapIain. They'd Iike
me to decide on who I shouId have at the...

410
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,513
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

411
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,469
when you get to the end,
you start to reaIise what's important to you,

412
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,358
you know, who reaIIy matters to you.

413
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,036
And, you know, that Ieaves you and Mike.

414
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,634
The onIy bIood I got Ieft in this...

415
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,075
this worId.

416
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,470
Yeah, I gotta say,
I'm not reaIIy foIIowing what you're saying.

417
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,710
WeII, uh...

418
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,639
In the end, the onIy thing that matters is Iove.

419
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,358
BIood, famiIy, you.

420
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,397
Um...

421
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,954
Give me your hand.

422
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,277
What are you doing?

423
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,920
Give me your hand.

424
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,350
Give me your hand.

425
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,555
I want you to be there when...

426
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,313
I want you to be there the day before I die.

427
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,510
So I can see you.

428
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,239
So I can hoId you.

429
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,917
I...

430
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,392
I Iove you. I've aIways Ioved you.

431
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,989
This whoIe thing...

432
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,155
I don't know if I can take it.

433
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,469
Me either.

434
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,313
I don't have a choice.

435
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,994
You do.

436
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,392
I am so sorry.

437
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,234
I met with this woman today
and she knew things about LincoIn's case.

438
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,756
Then she just disappeared.
I think something happened to her.

439
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,991
I'm gonna make this reaI easy for you.

440
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,868
Do you want to get married or not?

441
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,516
I don't know.

442
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,352
WonderfuI.

443
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,159
Maybe we couId postpone it. I can't do this
right now. It's supposed to be a ceIebration...

444
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,392
If you're reaIIy teIIing me
you want to postpone this thing,

445
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,119
then I want to canceI it.

446
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
Sebastian,

447
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,513
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,792
I'II come and get my stuff tomorrow.

449
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,268
(Bellick) Open on 40.

450
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,837
ScofieId.

451
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,831
Found you a new ceIIie.

452
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,799
I found him in psych ward.
You were the onIy guy with an empty tray.

453
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,995
Psych ward?

454
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,435
You got a probIem with that?

455
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,355
Cos if you do, pIease feeI free
to drop it into my suggestion box here.

456
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,751
Haywire, get in here.

457
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,679
CIose it up on 40.

458
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,114
Oh, and, ScofieId, just a heads-up,

459
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,998
don't make eye contact with him.

460
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,070
LincoIn, we have a probIem.
I got a new ceIImate.

461
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,037
Who?

462
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,437
- That's a probIem.
- We'II just have to bring him on board.

463
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,354
- You don't bring a guy Iike that on board.
- I'II work when he's sIeeping.

464
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,192
Ten feet, ScofieId.

465
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,478
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

466
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,154
I thought you said
the margin for error was zero days.

467
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,231
I did.

468
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,155
Ah!

469
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,753
Nice out here.

470
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,752
I got a buddy who's got a pIace
way back up in these woods.

471
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,400
Come up here hunting
around this time of year.

472
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,040
Man.

473
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,475
(muffled yells)

474
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,676
Back in. Back in.

475
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,075
Here. Come here.

476
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,194
- Take her out there.
- She's nothing.

477
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,193
Nobody wouId beIieve her
if she taIked, anyway.

478
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,272
A hundred yards or so shouId do it.

479
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,391
Do it.

480
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,277
Go!

481
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,751
(muffled cries)

482
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,317
I'm sorry.

483
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,676
- You gotta beIieve me.
- (train whistles)

484
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,479
(Hale) Dammit!

485
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,788
(screams)

486
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,795
PIease!

487
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,317
PIease!

488
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,918
PIease.

489
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,637
Pick up the casings.

490
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,196
What's your probIem?

491
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,274
I got a neuroanatomic Iesion
affecting my reticuIar activating system.

492
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,078
What does that mean?

493
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,515
It means I don't sIeep.

494
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,111
At aII.
