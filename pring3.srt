<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,463
I didn't kill that man...

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,840
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,636
Put down your weapon...

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,264
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison cell.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,143
- I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows.
- Man killed the VP's brother.

7
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,771
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,105
I'll get you out of here.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,691
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place.

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:29,780
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,658
- Find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,992
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,621
- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,501
You come around these bleachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,462
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:50,968
- Where is Fibonacci?
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

17
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,938
<i>(laughter)</i>

18
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,565
Yeah!

19
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,069
Oh, my God! Williamson, get in here!

20
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,782
- What the hell happened in here?
- An accident.

21
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,868
Let me get in here. Hold on. Come on.

22
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,210
Get out.

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,632
I thought you said you were
gonna have a conversation with him.

24
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,135
Yeah, I did.

25
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,763
Things... escalated.

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,518
We need some help here.

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,148
Bring him on into three.
Kathy, I'm gonna need 10ccs of Xylocaine.

28
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,740
Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here.

29
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,201
I said thank you. I'll take it from here.

30
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,203
Let's go.

31
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,459
OK, let's take a look at you.

32
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,337
You're OK. You're OK.

33
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,967
<i>(sobs)</i>

34
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,264
- What happened?
- Nothing.

35
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,559
This isn't nothing.
I need you to tell me what happened.

36
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,645
Don't make me lie to you.

37
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,482
Please.

38
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,192
All right, you guys?

39
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,861
- Yeah, no problem.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,656
IA should start an investigation.

41
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,659
Oh, there's no need. We know what happened.

42
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,745
Perhaps you'd enlighten me.

43
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,875
There was a pair of gardening shears left
on the floor of the shed. He stepped on them.

44
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,753
- The blade went right through his boot, huh?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,256
So why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,550
Like I said, Doc,

47
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,303
we got it taken care of.

48
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,472
Let's go.

49
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,588
<i>(pained groan)</i>

50
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,968
- I'll kill that scum.
- You kill him, you kill our ticket out of here.

51
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,056
Look what he did to you. You won't last
a second here unless I do something about it.

52
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,142
- You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:51,189
They operate flights from small airfields
in the Midwest, like the one ten miles away.

54
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,858
They're run by a shell corporation
Abruzzi owns.

55
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:58,154
We get him on board, there'll be
a flight for us the night we get outside.

56
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,908
You're willing to risk the entire escape
on a guy you don't know?

57
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:07,080
Preparation can only take you so far.
After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith.

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,961
- Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith.
- I'm not talking about Abruzzi.

59
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:18,049
There's someone else who holds the key
to this thing. It either works or it doesn't.

60
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,220
Problem is, I couldn't know
who that was until he got in here.

61
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,266
Sucre? You can't be serious.

62
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,395
The guy's a thief, Michael. He can't be trusted.

63
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,858
Gonna have to trust him,
because he's my cellmate.

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,570
- How well do you know him?
- About as well as a man can in a week.

65
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:43,533
You tell him, he tells everyone, we're done.
You know that, right?

66
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:48,413
If he's not on board, there's no digging
in that cell, and if there's no digging,

67
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,540
then there's no escape.

68
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,908
<i>(phone rings out)</i>

69

<i>(answerphone) Thank you for calling.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,921
Maricruz. It's me, baby. Are you there?

71
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,549
Pick up if you're there, Mari.
I've been in the SHU.

72
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,260
I've been thinking about you.

73
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,765
About your body.
God, I've been thinking about your body.

74
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,101
<i>- (woman) Hello?
- Mrs Delgado...</i>

75
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,313
Hi, how you doing? It's me, Fernando.

76
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,985
Sorry to bother you at home. Do you know
what's up with Maricruz's cellphone?

77
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:06,074
- Itjust keeps going straight to voice mail.
- Maybe she has it turned off.

78
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:10,537
- Any chance you know where she is?
- I know exactly where she is.

79
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,539
- And that would be?
- With Hector.

80
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,751
- Hector?
- That's right. They're at the mall, I think.

81
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:21,297
I don't suppose next time you see her
you could have her turn her phone back on?

82
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,302
Mrs Delgado, I know you don't like me,
but I love your daughter and she loves me.

83
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,429
We're gonna get married, you know?

84
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,891
If you were a decent man,
and you really loved her,

85
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,686
you'd let her live her life.

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,105
What's that supposed to mean?

87
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,732
I'll tell her you called.

88
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,054
- I'm looking to do some damage.
- Well, you've come to the right place.

89
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,723
I want to do it slow.

90
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:58,186
Inflict the maximum amount of pain
so a guy wishes he'd die, and get it over with,

91
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,730
butjust can't quite get there.

92
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,191
Oh, I got that.

93
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,486
I got that.

94
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,741
Look at this right here, boss.

95
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,205
I call it the gutter.

96
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,458
You jam it in the stomach.
These bits hook the intestines.

97
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:26,339
You give it a pull back, poor sucker's guts
are hanging right out of his stomach,

98
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,676
and he'll get a real good look at 'em
cos the wound's not fatal.

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,805
At least not until the infection sets in.

100
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,855
<i>(whispers) You're one sick puppy,
you know that?</i>

101
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,108
Thank you.

102
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,421
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

103
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:17,181
They've gotten to you, haven't they?
The other prisoners.

104
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,684
My God, Michael, this place is gonna kill you.

105
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,437
You said you talked to a woman.
What was her name?

106
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,606
- Leticia.
- Leticia Barris.

107
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,694
- How'd you know?
- A year ago I was doing what you're doing -

108
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,071
trying to find out the truth.

109
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,282
It's a bottomless pit, Veronica.

110
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,869
They designed it so that when you
got to the bottom of it Lincoln would be dead.

111
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,663
Why didn't you tell me?

112
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:47,753
Once the day was set, once that final appeal
had been rejected, he had 60 days to live.

113
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:53,426
I figured I could play their game and watch
him die, or take matters into my own hands.

114
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,678
You don't have to do that.

115
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,308
Leticia knows something. If I can get it
out of her, maybe we can reopen the case.

116
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,809
What'd she say?

117
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,479
Somebody else was behind
the killing of the vice president's brother.

118
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,358
- Who?
- She took off before I got anything out of her.

119
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,277
<i>(bell)</i>

120
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,655
She's holed up in the Elysian Fields project.
I'll go see her.

121
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,825
That place is dangerous.
Take someone with you.

122
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,037
- Who?
- Fianc�'d be a good place to start.

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,833
I think that's probably the last thing
in the world Sebastian would ever want to do.

124
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,836
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

125
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,430
No priors, a good student.

126
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,933
Then you get yourself arrested
for intent to sell.

127
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:48,189
- Good life get a little boring?
- It was stupid. It won't happen again.

128
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,858
Well, we're all here to make sure of that.

129
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,903
I spoke to your mother before you came in.

130
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,531
She told me that there were
some extenuating circumstances...

131
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,202
If you mean that guy at Fox River,
he's got nothing to do with this.

132
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:05,498
- He refuses to call him his father.
- The world would be better without him.

133
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,501
It's clear to me
you've got a lot of anger, young man.

134
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,754
Misdirected,
it could land you in the wrong place.

135
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,633
To make sure that doesn't happen,
you'll check in with me once a week.

136
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,968
Fridays. One hour.

137
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,555
- Your grades need to be pristine.
- Absolutely.

138
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,476
To give you an idea where
that anger will get you if you don't rein it in,

139
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,479
I'll sign you up
for the programme at Fox River.

140
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,608
You'll have a mentor who you'll work with.
Give you some perspective.

141
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,944
A mentor?

142
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,113
Your father.

143
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,285
<i>(man) Let's go. Pick up the pace.</i>

144
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:49,625
This ain't the Sistine Chapel, guys. Just
roll it up and down, move on to the next one.

145
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,054
Tell me that ain't what I think it is.

146
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,098
It ain't what you think it is.

147
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,519
Fish, a cellphone in here?
That's cardinal sin number one.

148
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,648
- They can tack two years onto your bid.
- If they catch you.

149
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,359
You know what trouble
I can get for knowing this?

Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

151
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:24,702
Now, that means you can make calls
whenever you want, right?

152
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,668
I don't like the look in your eye.
What's in there, you never saw it. Got it?

153
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,427
Why didn't you include any names?

154
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,096
Why would I want anyone to watch me die?

155
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,641
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

156
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:54,231
Some people want to go it alone, others have
grandiose statements they want to make,

157
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:59,028
but most want
some member of their family there

158
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,947
before they leave this world.

159
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,618
I'll do it alone.

160
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,537
Son, in my opinion,

161
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:15,294
all inmates who have made that choice
have deeply regretted it in their final minutes.

162
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,299
I'II...

163
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,470
leave it blank for now.

164
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,639
You have less than four weeks now.

165
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,600
You should give it some thought.

Hi, I'm looking for Leticia Barris.

168
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,084
- Five.
- Thank you.

169
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,189
Hello?

170
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,698
Don't you move a muscle.

171
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,415
Take it easy, Leticia.

172
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,669
You're working with 'em.
You think I'm stupid, lady?

173
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,839
I hear the clicks on my phone,
I see the cars on the street.

174
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,092
I know you're scared. I am too.

175
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,678
But, please, put the gun down.

176
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,351
Where you going?

177
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,645
Ireland. What difference does it make?

178
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:59,231
All the difference.
Nobody got your testimony.

179
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:01,900
That's the reason I'm still breathing.

180
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,988
- I'm not with them. You have to believe me.
- What you sneaking in here for?

181
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,074
- I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,077
Why do you care
about my wellbeing all of a sudden?

183
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,205
- I don't.
- Finally, an honest answer.

184
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,916
But maybe you can save Lincoln.

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,296
And maybe you can bring down the guys
who killed your boyfriend in the process.

186
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,801
If someone killed you and Crab could've done
something to them, you think he would have?

187
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,555
I'm not as strong as he was.
I can't take those people on.

188
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,932
I'll take them on.

189
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,603
All you have to do is come to my office
and tell me what you know.

190
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,231
I'll type it up,
you can sign the affidavit and split.

191
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,026
I'll take you to the airport myself.

Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

197
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,826
I want extra time outside
for the next two weeks.

Who?

201
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,131
Extra time outside, couple cigarettes.

202
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,259
Half-hour one week. One cigarette.

203

Know a con named Sucre?

204
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,532
This is what I don't understand, John.

205
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,076
Otto Fibonacci fingers you.

206
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:22,290
He put you in prison for life, yet you act like
you don't even want to find out where he is.

207
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,459
That's not true, Philly.

208
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:29,840
Maybe you don't think you have anything
to lose any more. You're already locked up.

209
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,301
Maybe you like it here. I don't know.

210
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,556
But what I do know
is that if Fibonacci testifies next month,

211
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,891
you and I are gonna be neighbours.

212
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,394
And I am not going to let that happen.

213
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:46,565
I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

214
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:51,486
Fancy suits and ties and shirts.

215
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:57,075
I think you're right, so let's cut to the chase.

216
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,164
Did you break this kid?
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

217
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:14,384
- What is this?
- It's a little gift from me to you.

218
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:21,766
- Are these his?
- Yeah. He won't crack.

219
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:29,441
Well, perhaps you should consider
using a different methodology then, John.

220
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:34,487
From what I gather, there are far worse
threats in prison other than bodily harm.

221
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:38,283
What happened to the days
when you used to trust me, Philly,

222
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,327
that I would get things done?

223
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,163
That was when you actually
did get things done.

I imagine pretty good, huh?

235

You know, visitation rules stipulate
that conjugals are only for married couples.

236
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:44,974
We're engaged. Besides, I got that coming
to me cos I ain't caused no static in this place.

00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,770
Please, don't dead my conjugals.

238
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,272
I won't.

239
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,108
Thank you.

240
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:59,364
But in exchange,
you have to tell me where that cellphone is.

241
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,699
Cellphone?

242

a chance to save your precious conjugals.

You lie to me, they're gone
and they're never coming back.

00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:48,997
Turner, your transfer came in.
They want you in administration.

I lost my conjugals over soap?

You may have lost your conjugals, but
I can do you one better. I can get you to her.

252
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:38,755
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:41,174
Yeah? How you gonna do that?

254
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:45,220
We're breaking out of here.

00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,308
- Starts in our cell.
- In our cell?

257
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:56,606
- To tell you the truth, it's already started.
- Ah.

258
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,943
Are you crazy?
You think I want to break out of here?

259
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:01,945
16 months from now I'm at the gate.

263
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,956
I had to see if you could keep a secret.

You want a secret? I got a secret for you, fish.

That went well.

268
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,693
Let's start with Lincoln's relationship
with your boyfriend.

269
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:46,155
He owed my man 90,000. He wasn't getting
it done. All of a sudden, it gets done.

270
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,741
Crab walks up with 90k and a big-ass smile.

271
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,619
- Who paid him?
- Not Lincoln. They paid his marker.

272
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,414
Who's they?

273
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:59,168
It's all right, Leticia.
I told you, you're safe here.

274
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,506
Crab brought this guy home.
Never seen him before.

275
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:09,053
Crab did what he always did. He told me
to take a walk, so that's exactly what I did.

276
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:13,141
There was something about this guy.
He wasn't the kind he usually dealt with.

277
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,350
What do you mean?

278
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,187
Couldn't put my finger on it
till he went outside. Then I knew.

279
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,023
- He had that look.
- What look?

280
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:24,610
<i>(Leticia) Like they own the place,
like they're untouchable,</i>

283
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:34,996
- Did Crab say what they wanted in return?
- Uh-uh.

284
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,542
All right. Just give me
a moment to type this up.

285
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,253
- Where are you going?
- To have a smoke.

286
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,674
- This is only gonna take me a minute.
- So will the smoke.

287
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:55,224
No swelling, so there's no sign of infection.
I'll keep you on antibiotics for ten days.

288
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,351
You should be good.

289
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:04,984
You understand by law I must file a report
if I feel there has been prisoner misconduct?

290
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:09,363
There's no way this injury happened
by stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

291
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,575
If you file the report,
things could get a lot worse.

292
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:16,871
- They're not already?
- Not compared to what they could be.

293
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,375
- I've made some enemies.
- Yeah.

294
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,628
You scared?

295
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:27,924
Men. OK.

296
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:31,135
Here's what I think. I think you are scared.

297
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:36,224
And you wouldn't be human
if you weren't scared in a place like this.

298
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:39,185
When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night,

299
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:42,647
because I thought
there was a monster in the closet,

300
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,984
but my brother told me
there wasn't anything in the closet but fear,

301
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,612
and fear wasn't real.

302
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:53,741
He said it wasn't made of anything.
It was just... air.

303
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,329
Not even that. He said you just have to face it.

304
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:02,124
You just have to open that door,
and the monster would disappear.

305
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,671
- Your brother sounds like a smart man.
- He is.

306
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:12,468
In here, though,
you face your fear, you open that door,

307
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:15,972
and there's a hundred more doors behind it.

308
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:21,519
And the monsters
that are hiding behind them are all real.

309
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,397
If you want,
I could recommend you be sent to ad seg.

310
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:27,775
With the rape victims and the snitches.

311
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:30,528
It would keep you safe.

312
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:35,533
Thanks, but I think I'd like
to face the monsters on my own.

313
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,664
Have a good smoke?

314
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:44,041
<i>(Kellerman) I don't smoke.</i>

315
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,089
Didn't mean to startle you.

316
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:53,968
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

317
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:58,139
We've been informed that you obtained
a copy of the surveillance tape

318
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,933
entered as evidence in the Burrows trial.

319
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,145
- Is there a problem with that?
- We're just following up.

320
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:10,443
Has there been an amendment to the Freedom
of Information Act that I'm not aware of?

321
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:15,322
When a prisoner gets near the end of his time
on death row, there's a lot of last-minute...

322
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:19,410
I don't understand why this would
be a problem for the Secret Service.

323
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:23,914
It's not. The prosecution made its case
far beyond any reasonable doubt

324
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:27,001
and we know that we have the right man.

325
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:30,671
That being said, if you come across anything

326
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:35,509
that could shed some light on his innocence,
I'm offering my help.

327
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,138
Sounds great.
I really appreciate you coming by.

328
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,729
- Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?
- Of course.

329
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,857
Don't hesitate to call.

330
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,901
Thanks.

331
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,704
Leticia.

332
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,852
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

333
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,896
<i>(phone rings)</i>

334
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:33,359
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry.
- Where are you?

335
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:37,947
- This isn't the time. I'm sorry.
- This is the time. I'm at the reception hall.

336
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,158
<i>The coordinator's here, the vendors.</i>

337
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:45,538
Look, l-I'm just...
I'm sorry. L-I can't talk right now.

338
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,766
I say we take his whole foot.

339
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:09,770
<i>(Abruzzi) We could cut off all his limbs.
He still wouldn't talk.</i>

340
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:15,025
Pain is not the answer here.

341
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:18,737
Maybe the Beatles were right after all.

342
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:21,949
Maybe all you need is love.

343
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:28,747
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like? I'm rolling it up.

344
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:32,001
- You can't do this.
- I'm done with your reindeer games.

345
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:35,462
I'm gonna transfer to a nice,
quiet cell with a normal cellie,

346
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,840
one that doesn't screw my entire life up.

347
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:41,885
<i>(low voice) Look, I'm sorry
about your conjugals,</i>

348
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:45,347
but if you go now...

349
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:49,601
- Don't do this. Please.
- Listen to me, fish.

350
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:53,105
I got 16 months. I got a fianc�e to think about.

351
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:58,527
I get caught with a hole in my wall, I don't
get to see the world for another five years.

352
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,030
Let's go, Sucre.

353
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:04,950
- I can't do that.
- There is a solution. We can work it out.

354
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,454
Sorry, fish.

355
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:17,046
Can I ask you something?

356
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:21,341
Why have you denied any family
or loved ones to be there for you in the end?

357
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:24,094
Why would I let them watch me die?

358
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,305
I've caused them enough pain.

359
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:31,268
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

360
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:34,021
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

361
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:37,107
- That the final torture?
- No.

362
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:40,152
It's about how you want to leave this world.

363
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,280
What's the last image
you want to take with you?

364
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:46,200
A stranger?

365
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,758
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

366
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:05,427
You don't give the green light.

367
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:08,305
Everything in here runs through me.
You know that.

368
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:12,643
May Tag's in the ground
because of that piece of detritus.

369
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:17,439
- So now you want him.
- Every day for the rest of his bid.

370
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:22,194
Seems you and I
have something in common, then.

371
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,952
Get in!

372
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:35,916
Easy, now, fish. Don't make this
any harder than it needs to be.

373
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:40,921
It's time we came to an arrangement,
don't you think?

374
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:58,188
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you
bow to stern as soon as I laid eyes on you,

375
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:03,986
but, alackaday, you look so pretty
when you're scared, don't you?

376
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:12,035
Maybe we oughta get the love out of the way
before the hate. What do you say, pretty?

377
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:18,417
Yeah. Yeah, maybe it's time
I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?

378
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:25,299
God, he talks too much.

379
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:29,636
You and I need to have a conversation.

380
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,025
What happened in there
was my way of saying

381
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:47,738
I know I've been going about
this whole thing the wrong way.

382
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:49,823
<i>(man) We've got a man down!</i>

383
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:52,868
<i>- I'm trying to make amends.
- (man) We need some help.</i>

384
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:55,454
<i>- Bygones be bygones.
- (man) We need a doctor.</i>

385
00:31:55,912 --> 00:32:00,083
- You're a mercurial man, John.
- I prefer bold.

386
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:03,587
<i>(man #2) Come on,
just keep it moving, guys. Come on!</i>

387
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:09,134
<i>- (Abruzzi) Tell me what you need from me.
- A trade.</i>

388
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:12,846
You get me a plane, and I'll get you Fibonacci.

389
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:16,933
<i>- (Abruzzi) What do you need a plane for?
- (Michael) I think you know.</i>

390
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:20,520
<i>(Abruzzi) I help you, I'm in.
You know that, don't you?</i>

391
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,439
I do.

392
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:27,069
- Just gotta know the exact date and time.
- I'll tell you soon enough.

393
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:31,698
Soon enough won't cut it. I need
to be outside before Fibonacci testifies.

394
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,408
You will be.

395
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:38,080
- He testifies in one month.
- Then you'll be out in plenty of time.

396
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:41,708
If not, you're a corpse.

397
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:49,883
So cut the crap. Tell me the exact date and
time so I can start making the arrangements.

398
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:52,511
- I don't know if I can trust you yet.
- Why not?

399
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:55,931
Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man.

400
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:08,902
- Lewis, take these off.
- Sink, I can't do that.

401
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:12,739
Come on, man. I'm in a cage. Ten minutes.

402
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:15,116
Please.

403
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,494
It's my kid.

404
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:33,635
<i>(awkwardly) So, here we are.</i>

405
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,888
Yeah.

406
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:42,310
- How you been?
- You know, in trouble.

407
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,521
How's your mom?

408
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:49,442
- She's good.
- Hey, um...

409
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:57,200
I've been talking to the chaplain. They'd like
me to decide on who I should have at the...

410
00:33:58,326 --> 00:34:01,121
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

411
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:06,293
when you get to the end,
you start to realise what's important to you,

412
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:09,296
you know, who really matters to you.

413
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:16,261
And, you know, that leaves you and Mike.

414
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,972
The only blood I got left in this...

415
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:21,516
this world.

416
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,061
Yeah, I gotta say,
I'm not really following what you're saying.

417
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:27,397
Well, uh...

418
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:33,570
In the end, the only thing that matters is love.

419
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:39,534
Blood, family, you.

420
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:46,875
Um...

421
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,843
Give me your hand.

422
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,262
What are you doing?

423
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:02,015
Give me your hand.

424
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:04,559
Give me your hand.

425
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:16,237
I want you to be there when...

426
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,158
I want you to be there the day before I die.

427
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:24,537
So I can see you.

428
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,373
So I can hold you.

429
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:35,381
I...

430
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:41,096
I love you. I've always loved you.

431
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:53,191
This whole thing...

432
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:58,571
I don't know if I can take it.

433
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:03,076
Me either.

434
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:06,037
I don't have a choice.

435
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:08,832
You do.

436
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:33,231
I am so sorry.

437
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:37,235
I met with this woman today
and she knew things about Lincoln's case.

438
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:40,905
Then she just disappeared.
I think something happened to her.

439
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:44,284
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

440
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:48,329
Do you want to get married or not?

441
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,210
I don't know.

442
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:56,129
Wonderful.

443
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:03,219
Maybe we could postpone it. I can't do this
right now. It's supposed to be a celebration...

444
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:07,640
If you're really telling me
you want to postpone this thing,

445
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:10,476
then I want to cancel it.

446
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:17,400
Sebastian,

447
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:20,278
I'm sorry.

448
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,741
I'll come and get my stuff tomorrow.

449
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:58,608
<i>(Bellick) Open on 40.</i>

450
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:03,363
Scofield.

451
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,448
Found you a new cellie.

452
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:09,577
I found him in psych ward.
You were the only guy with an empty tray.

453
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,828
Psych ward?

454
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:13,373
You got a problem with that?

455
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:18,503
Cos if you do, please feel free
to drop it into my suggestion box here.

456
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:29,347
Haywire, get in here.

457
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,562
Close it up on 40.

458
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
Oh, and, Scofield, just a heads-up,

459
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:47,323
don't make eye contact with him.

460
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:16,602
Lincoln, we have a problem.
I got a new cellmate.

461
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,646
Who?

462
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:23,234
- That's a problem.
- We'll just have to bring him on board.

463
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:27,321
- You don't bring a guy like that on board.
- I'll work when he's sleeping.

464
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:29,240
Ten feet, Scofield.

465
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,959
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

466
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,753
I thought you said
the margin for error was zero days.

467
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,922
I did.

468
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,035
Ah!

469
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:15,703
Nice out here.

470
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:18,831
I got a buddy who's got a place
way back up in these woods.

471
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:21,584
Come up here hunting
around this time of year.

472
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,337
Man.

473
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,881
<i>(muffled yells)</i>

474
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:29,175
Back in. Back in.

475
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:35,848
Here. Come here.

476
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:39,101
- Take her out there.
- She's nothing.

477
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:43,272
Nobody would believe her
if she talked, anyway.

478
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:46,484
A hundred yards or so should do it.

479
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:49,737
Do it.

480
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,697
Go!

481
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,753
<i>(muffled cries)</i>

482
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:08,422
I'm sorry.

483
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:11,926
<i>- You gotta believe me.
- (train whistles)</i>

484
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:14,845
<i>(Hale) Dammit!</i>

485
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:16,222
<i>(screams)</i>

486
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:40,204
Please!

487
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:43,874
Please!

488
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:48,671
Please.

489
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:01,934
Pick up the casings.

490
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,611
What's your problem?

491
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:58,908
I got a neuroanatomic lesion
affecting my reticular activating system.

492
00:42:58,991 --> 00:43:00,784
What does that mean?

493
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:03,329
It means I don't sleep.

494
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:07,082
At all.

495
00:43:47,665 --> 00:43:50,626
