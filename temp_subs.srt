00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't kill that man.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison cell.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- I'm looking for Lincoln Burrows.
- Man killed the VP's brother.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get you out of here.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that. I've got 'em on me.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,658
- Find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

12
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:03,992
The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:07,621
- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

14
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:12,501
You come around these bleachers again, it's
gonna be more than words we're exchanging.

15
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:15,462
- Someone found Fibonacci.
- Who was this someone?

16
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:20,968
- Where is Fibonacci?
- I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

17
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:32,938
<i>(laughter)</i>

18
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,565
Yeah!

19
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,069
Oh, my God! Williamson, get in here!

20
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:43,782
- What the hell happened in here?
- An accident.

21
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:46,868
Let me get in here. Hold on. Come on.

22
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,210
Get out.

23
00:00:57,087 --> 00:01:00,632
I thought you said you were
gonna have a conversation with him.

24
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:03,135
Yeah, I did.

25
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:06,763
Things... escalated.

26
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,518
We need some help here.

27
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:16,148
Bring him on into three.
Kathy, I'm gonna need 10ccs of Xylocaine.

28
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:24,740
Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here.

29
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:28,201
I said thank you. I'll take it from here.

30
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:30,203
Let's go.

31
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,459
OK, let's take a look at you.

32
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:39,337
You're OK. You're OK.

33
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:43,967
<i>(sobs)</i>

34
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:49,264
- What happened?
- Nothing.

35
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:52,559
This isn't nothing.
I need you to tell me what happened.

36
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:55,645
Don't make me lie to you.

37
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:58,482
Please.

38
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:00,192
All right, you guys?

39
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:02,861
- Yeah, no problem.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:06,656
IA should start an investigation.

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,659
Oh, there's no need. We know what happened.

42
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,745
Perhaps you'd enlighten me.

43
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:16,875
There was a pair of gardening shears left
on the floor of the shed. He stepped on them.

44
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,753
- The blade went right through his boot, huh?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:23,256
So why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,550
Like I said, Doc,

47
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:28,303
we got it taken care of.

48
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:30,472
Let's go.

49
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,588
<i>(pained groan)</i>

50
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:07,968
- I'll kill that scum.
- You kill him, you kill our ticket out of here.

51
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,056
Look what he did to you. You won't last
a second here unless I do something about it.

52
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,142
- You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:21,189
They operate flights from small airfields
in the Midwest, like the one ten miles away.

54
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:23,858
They're run by a shell corporation
Abruzzi owns.

55
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:28,154
We get him on board, there'll be
a flight for us the night we get outside.

56
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:31,908
You're willing to risk the entire escape
on a guy you don't know?

57
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:37,080
Preparation can only take you so far.
After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith.

58
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,961
- Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith.
- I'm not talking about Abruzzi.

59
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:48,049
There's someone else who holds the key
to this thing. It either works or it doesn't.

60
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:52,220
Problem is, I couldn't know
who that was until he got in here.

61
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:56,266
Sucre? You can't be serious.

62
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:00,395
The guy's a thief, Michael. He can't be trusted.

63
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:04,858
Gonna have to trust him,
because he's my cellmate.

64
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:08,570
- How well do you know him?
- About as well as a man can in a week.

65
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:13,533
You tell him, he tells everyone, we're done.
You know that, right?

66
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:18,413
If he's not on board, there's no digging
in that cell, and if there's no digging,

67
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:20,540
then there's no escape.

68
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:54,908
<i>(phone rings out)</i>

69
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:04,167
<i>(answerphone) Thank you for calling.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

70
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,921
Maricruz. It's me, baby. Are you there?

71
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:11,549
Pick up if you're there, Mari.
I've been in the SHU.

72
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,260
I've been thinking about you.

73
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:18,765
About your body.
God, I've been thinking about your body.

74
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:22,101
<i>- (woman) Hello?
- Mrs Delgado...</i>

75
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,313
Hi, how you doing? It's me, Fernando.

76
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:30,985
Sorry to bother you at home. Do you know
what's up with Maricruz's cellphone?

77
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:36,074
- Itjust keeps going straight to voice mail.
- Maybe she has it turned off.

78
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:40,537
- Any chance you know where she is?
- I know exactly where she is.

79
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,539
- And that would be?
- With Hector.

80
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:46,751
- Hector?
- That's right. They're at the mall, I think.

81
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:51,297
I don't suppose next time you see her
you could have her turn her phone back on?

82
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:56,302
Mrs Delgado, I know you don't like me,
but I love your daughter and she loves me.

83
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,429
We're gonna get married, you know?

84
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:01,891
If you were a decent man,
and you really loved her,

85
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,686
you'd let her live her life.

86
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,105
What's that supposed to mean?

87
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,732
I'll tell her you called.

88
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:21,054
- I'm looking to do some damage.
- Well, you've come to the right place.

89
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:23,723
I want to do it slow.

90
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:28,186
Inflict the maximum amount of pain
so a guy wishes he'd die, and get it over with,

91
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,730
butjust can't quite get there.

92
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:33,191
Oh, I got that.

93
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,486
I got that.

94
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,741
Look at this right here, boss.

95
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:47,205
I call it the gutter.

96
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:50,458
You jam it in the stomach.
These bits hook the intestines.

97
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:56,339
You give it a pull back, poor sucker's guts
are hanging right out of his stomach,

98
00:07:56,422 --> 00:08:00,676
and he'll get a real good look at 'em
cos the wound's not fatal.

99
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,805
At least not until the infection sets in.

100
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:12,855
<i>(whispers) You're one sick puppy,
you know that?</i>

101
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:16,108
Thank you.

102
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:37,421
- What happened?
- I'm OK.

103
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:47,181
They've gotten to you, haven't they?
The other prisoners.

104
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,684
My God, Michael, this place is gonna kill you.

105
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,437
You said you talked to a woman.
What was her name?

106
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,606
- Leticia.
- Leticia Barris.

107
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,694
- How'd you know?
- A year ago I was doing what you're doing -

108
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:02,071
trying to find out the truth.

109
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:04,282
It's a bottomless pit, Veronica.

110
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:08,869
They designed it so that when you
got to the bottom of it Lincoln would be dead.

111
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,663
Why didn't you tell me?

112
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:17,753
Once the day was set, once that final appeal
had been rejected, he had 60 days to live.

113
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:23,426
I figured I could play their game and watch
him die, or take matters into my own hands.

114
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,678
You don't have to do that.

115
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:30,308
Leticia knows something. If I can get it
out of her, maybe we can reopen the case.

116
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,809
What'd she say?

117
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:35,479
Somebody else was behind
the killing of the vice president's brother.

118
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:39,358
- Who?
- She took off before I got anything out of her.

119
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:41,277
<i>(bell)</i>

120
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,655
She's holed up in the Elysian Fields project.
I'll go see her.

121
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:47,825
That place is dangerous.
Take someone with you.

122
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:51,037
- Who?
- FiancÃ©'d be a good place to start.

123
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,833
I think that's probably the last thing
in the world Sebastian would ever want to do.

124
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,836
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

125
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:09,430
No priors, a good student.

126
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:12,933
Then you get yourself arrested
for intent to sell.

127
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:18,189
- Good life get a little boring?
- It was stupid. It won't happen again.

128
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,858
Well, we're all here to make sure of that.

129
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,903
I spoke to your mother before you came in.

130
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:27,531
She told me that there were
some extenuating circumstances...

131
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:31,202
If you mean that guy at Fox River,
he's got nothing to do with this.

132
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:35,498
- He refuses to call him his father.
- The world would be better without him.

133
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,501
It's clear to me
you've got a lot of anger, young man.

134
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:41,754
Misdirected,
it could land you in the wrong place.

135
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:45,633
To make sure that doesn't happen,
you'll check in with me once a week.

136
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,968
Fridays. One hour.

137
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:51,555
- Your grades need to be pristine.
- Absolutely.

138
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,476
To give you an idea where
that anger will get you if you don't rein it in,

139
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,479
I'll sign you up
for the programme at Fox River.

140
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:02,608
You'll have a mentor who you'll work with.
Give you some perspective.

141
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,944
A mentor?

142
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,113
Your father.

143
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,285
<i>(man) Let's go. Pick up the pace.</i>

144
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:19,625
This ain't the Sistine Chapel, guys. Just
roll it up and down, move on to the next one.

145
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,054
Tell me that ain't what I think it is.

146
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:34,098
It ain't what you think it is.

147
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:38,519
Fish, a cellphone in here?
That's cardinal sin number one.

148
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:42,648
- They can tack two years onto your bid.
- If they catch you.

149
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:45,359
You know what trouble
I can get for knowing this?

150
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,153
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

151
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:54,702
Now, that means you can make calls
whenever you want, right?

152
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,668
I don't like the look in your eye.
What's in there, you never saw it. Got it?

153
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,427
Why didn't you include any names?

154
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,096
Why would I want anyone to watch me die?

155
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:17,641
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

156
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:24,231
Some people want to go it alone, others have
grandiose statements they want to make,

157
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:29,028
but most want
some member of their family there

158
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,947
before they leave this world.

159
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:35,618
I'll do it alone.

160
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,537
Son, in my opinion,

161
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:45,294
all inmates who have made that choice
have deeply regretted it in their final minutes.

162
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,299
I'II...

163
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,470
leave it blank for now.

164
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:56,639
You have less than four weeks now.

165
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:59,600
You should give it some thought.

167
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,498
Hi, I'm looking for Leticia Barris.

168
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,084
- Five.
- Thank you.

169
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,189
Hello?

170
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:56,698
Don't you move a muscle.

171
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:05,415
Take it easy, Leticia.

172
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,669
You're working with 'em.
You think I'm stupid, lady?

173
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:11,839
I hear the clicks on my phone,
I see the cars on the street.

174
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:15,092
I know you're scared. I am too.

175
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,678
But, please, put the gun down.

176
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,351
Where you going?

177
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:26,645
Ireland. What difference does it make?

178
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:29,231
All the difference.
Nobody got your testimony.

179
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,900
That's the reason I'm still breathing.

180
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:35,988
- I'm not with them. You have to believe me.
- What you sneaking in here for?

181
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:39,074
- I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,077
Why do you care
about my wellbeing all of a sudden?

183
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,205
- I don't.
- Finally, an honest answer.

184
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,916
But maybe you can save Lincoln.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,296
And maybe you can bring down the guys
who killed your boyfriend in the process.

186
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:57,801
If someone killed you and Crab could've done
something to them, you think he would have?

187
00:14:57,885 --> 00:15:01,555
I'm not as strong as he was.
I can't take those people on.

188
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:03,932
I'll take them on.

189
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,603
All you have to do is come to my office
and tell me what you know.

190
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:11,231
I'll type it up,
you can sign the affidavit and split.

191
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:14,026
I'll take you to the airport myself.

192
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:40,802
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

196
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:01,698
Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

197
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,826
I want extra time outside
for the next two weeks.

198
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,829
Paint fumes in PI must be getting to you.

199
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,374
Cellphones allowed in here?

200
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,252
Who?

201
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:18,131
Extra time outside, couple cigarettes.

202
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:21,259
Half-hour one week. One cigarette.

203
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:31,436
Know a con named Sucre?

204
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,532
This is what I don't understand, John.

205
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,076
Otto Fibonacci fingers you.

206
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:52,290
He put you in prison for life, yet you act like
you don't even want to find out where he is.

207
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:54,459
That's not true, Philly.

208
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:59,840
Maybe you don't think you have anything
to lose any more. You're already locked up.

209
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:03,301
Maybe you like it here. I don't know.

210
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:07,556
But what I do know
is that if Fibonacci testifies next month,

211
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,891
you and I are gonna be neighbours.

212
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,394
And I am not going to let that happen.

213
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:16,565
I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

214
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:21,486
Fancy suits and ties and shirts.

215
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:27,075
I think you're right, so let's cut to the chase.

216
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:32,164
Did you break this kid?
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

217
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:44,384
- What is this?
- It's a little gift from me to you.

218
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:51,766
- Are these his?
- Yeah. He won't crack.

219
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:59,441
Well, perhaps you should consider
using a different methodology then, John.

220
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:04,487
From what I gather, there are far worse
threats in prison other than bodily harm.

221
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:08,283
What happened to the days
when you used to trust me, Philly,

222
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:10,327
that I would get things done?

223
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,163
That was when you actually
did get things done.

Did you hear the news?

227
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,594
What... what news?

228
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:30,764
We're going to stay
with Uncle Philly at the lake.

229
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:34,476
Yeah, and we're gonna have a good time.

230
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,062
You're right, John. Maybe you're right.

231
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,356
I do trust you.

232
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:43,443
Now, you're gonna
take care of that thing, aren't you?

233
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:56,456
How are those bone-yard visits
going with that girlfriend of yours?

234
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,250
I imagine pretty good, huh?

235
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:08,218
You know, visitation rules stipulate
that conjugals are only for married couples.

236
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:14,974
We're engaged. Besides, I got that coming
to me cos I ain't caused no static in this place.

237
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:18,770
Please, don't dead my conjugals.

238
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,272
I won't.

239
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:23,108
Thank you.

240
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:29,364
But in exchange,
you have to tell me where that cellphone is.

241
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:30,699
Cellphone?

242
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:35,370
Don't play stupid with me. I'm giving you
a chance to save your precious conjugals.

243
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:40,458
You lie to me, they're gone
and they're never coming back.

244
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:44,713
Where's that cellphone?

245
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:18,997
Turner, your transfer came in.
They want you in administration.

246
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:34,387
He didn't talk.

247
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:45,773
All I got to say is I better get
to make all the calls I want.

248
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:52,238
Gonna be kinda hard.

249
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:58,369
Soap?

250
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:01,122
I lost my conjugals over soap?

251
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:05,710
You may have lost your conjugals, but
I can do you one better. I can get you to her.

252
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:08,755
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

253
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:11,174
Yeah? How you gonna do that?

254
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:15,220
We're breaking out of here.

255
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,055
How?

256
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:20,308
- Starts in our cell.
- In our cell?

257
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:26,606
- To tell you the truth, it's already started.
- Ah.

258
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:29,943
Are you crazy?
You think I want to break out of here?

259
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,945
16 months from now I'm at the gate.

260
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:35,323
I'm getting married,
and not with no posse on my ass.

261
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:37,617
I oughta beat you six ways till Sunday.

262
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,662
I lost my conjugals
because of your little bar of soap.

263
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,956
I had to see if you could keep a secret.

264
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,917
You want a secret? I got a secret for you, fish.

265
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,546
You dig in my cell when I'm there,
and I'm gonna split your wig.

266
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,549
<i>Â¿ TÃº me estÃ¡s entendiendo?</i>

267
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,058
That went well.

268
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:11,693
Let's start with Lincoln's relationship
with your boyfriend.

269
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:16,155
He owed my man 90,000. He wasn't getting
it done. All of a sudden, it gets done.

270
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,741
Crab walks up with 90k and a big-ass smile.

271
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:21,619
- Who paid him?
- Not Lincoln. They paid his marker.

272
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:24,414
Who's they?

273
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:29,168
It's all right, Leticia.
I told you, you're safe here.

274
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,506
Crab brought this guy home.
Never seen him before.

275
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:39,053
Crab did what he always did. He told me
to take a walk, so that's exactly what I did.

276
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:43,141
There was something about this guy.
He wasn't the kind he usually dealt with.

277
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:44,350
What do you mean?

278
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:48,187
Couldn't put my finger on it
till he went outside. Then I knew.

279
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:51,023
- He had that look.
- What look?

280
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:54,610
<i>(Leticia) Like they own the place,
like they're untouchable,</i>

281
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:56,696
like they're government.

282
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:00,283
<i>(Veronica)
So the government paid Lincoln's debt?</i>

283
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:04,996
- Did Crab say what they wanted in return?
- Uh-uh.

284
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,542
All right. Just give me
a moment to type this up.

285
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:12,253
- Where are you going?
- To have a smoke.

286
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:16,674
- This is only gonna take me a minute.
- So will the smoke.

287
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:25,224
No swelling, so there's no sign of infection.
I'll keep you on antibiotics for ten days.

288
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:27,351
You should be good.

289
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:34,984
You understand by law I must file a report
if I feel there has been prisoner misconduct?

290
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:39,363
There's no way this injury happened
by stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

291
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:42,575
If you file the report,
things could get a lot worse.

292
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:46,871
- They're not already?
- Not compared to what they could be.

293
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,375
- I've made some enemies.
- Yeah.

294
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,628
You scared?

295
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,924
Men. OK.

296
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:01,135
Here's what I think. I think you are scared.

297
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:06,224
And you wouldn't be human
if you weren't scared in a place like this.

298
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:09,185
When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night,

299
00:24:09,268 --> 00:24:12,647
because I thought
there was a monster in the closet,

300
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,984
but my brother told me
there wasn't anything in the closet but fear,

301
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,612
and fear wasn't real.

302
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:23,741
He said it wasn't made of anything.
It was just... air.

303
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,329
Not even that. He said you just have to face it.

304
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:32,124
You just have to open that door,
and the monster would disappear.

305
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:36,671
- Your brother sounds like a smart man.
- He is.

306
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:42,468
In here, though,
you face your fear, you open that door,

307
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,972
and there's a hundred more doors behind it.

308
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:51,519
And the monsters
that are hiding behind them are all real.

309
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,397
If you want,
I could recommend you be sent to ad seg.

310
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:57,775
With the rape victims and the snitches.

311
00:24:57,858 --> 00:25:00,528
It would keep you safe.

312
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:05,533
Thanks, but I think I'd like
to face the monsters on my own.

313
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,664
Have a good smoke?

314
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,041
<i>(Kellerman) I don't smoke.</i>

315
00:25:17,837 --> 00:25:20,089
Didn't mean to startle you.

316
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:23,968
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

317
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:28,139
We've been informed that you obtained
a copy of the surveillance tape

318
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,933
entered as evidence in the Burrows trial.

319
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:34,145
- Is there a problem with that?
- We're just following up.

320
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:40,443
Has there been an amendment to the Freedom
of Information Act that I'm not aware of?

321
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:45,322
When a prisoner gets near the end of his time
on death row, there's a lot of last-minute...

322
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:49,410
I don't understand why this would
be a problem for the Secret Service.

323
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:53,914
It's not. The prosecution made its case
far beyond any reasonable doubt

324
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:57,001
and we know that we have the right man.

325
00:25:57,084 --> 00:26:00,671
That being said, if you come across anything

326
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:05,509
that could shed some light on his innocence,
I'm offering my help.

327
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:09,138
Sounds great.
I really appreciate you coming by.

328
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,729
- Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?
- Of course.

329
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,857
Don't hesitate to call.

330
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,901
Thanks.

331
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:33,704
Leticia.

332
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,852
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

333
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:58,896
<i>(phone rings)</i>

334
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:03,359
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry.
- Where are you?

335
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:07,947
- This isn't the time. I'm sorry.
- This is the time. I'm at the reception hall.

336
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,158
<i>The coordinator's here, the vendors.</i>

337
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:15,538
Look, l-I'm just...
I'm sorry. L-I can't talk right now.

338
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,766
I say we take his whole foot.

339
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:39,770
<i>(Abruzzi) We could cut off all his limbs.
He still wouldn't talk.</i>

340
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:45,025
Pain is not the answer here.

341
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:48,737
Maybe the Beatles were right after all.

342
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:51,949
Maybe all you need is love.

343
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:58,747
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like? I'm rolling it up.

344
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:02,001
- You can't do this.
- I'm done with your reindeer games.

345
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:05,462
I'm gonna transfer to a nice,
quiet cell with a normal cellie,

346
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:07,840
one that doesn't screw my entire life up.

347
00:28:07,923 --> 00:28:11,885
<i>(low voice) Look, I'm sorry
about your conjugals,</i>

348
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:15,347
but if you go now...

349
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:19,601
- Don't do this. Please.
- Listen to me, fish.

350
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:23,105
I got 16 months. I got a fiancÃ©e to think about.

351
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:28,527
I get caught with a hole in my wall, I don't
get to see the world for another five years.

352
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,030
Let's go, Sucre.

353
00:28:31,113 --> 00:28:34,950
- I can't do that.
- There is a solution. We can work it out.

354
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,454
Sorry, fish.

355
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:47,046
Can I ask you something?

356
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:51,341
Why have you denied any family
or loved ones to be there for you in the end?

357
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:54,094
Why would I let them watch me die?

358
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:56,305
I've caused them enough pain.

359
00:28:56,764 --> 00:29:01,268
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

360
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:04,021
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

361
00:29:04,104 --> 00:29:07,107
- That the final torture?
- No.

362
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:10,152
It's about how you want to leave this world.

363
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:13,280
What's the last image
you want to take with you?

364
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:16,200
A stranger?

365
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:32,758
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

366
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:35,427
You don't give the green light.

367
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:38,305
Everything in here runs through me.
You know that.

368
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:42,643
May Tag's in the ground
because of that piece of detritus.

369
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:47,439
- So now you want him.
- Every day for the rest of his bid.

370
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:52,194
Seems you and I
have something in common, then.

371
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,952
Get in!

372
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:05,916
Easy, now, fish. Don't make this
any harder than it needs to be.

373
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:10,921
It's time we came to an arrangement,
don't you think?

374
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:28,188
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you
bow to stern as soon as I laid eyes on you,

375
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:33,986
but, alackaday, you look so pretty
when you're scared, don't you?

376
00:30:35,654 --> 00:30:42,035
Maybe we oughta get the love out of the way
before the hate. What do you say, pretty?

377
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:48,417
Yeah. Yeah, maybe it's time
I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?

378
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:55,299
God, he talks too much.

379
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:59,636
You and I need to have a conversation.

380
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,025
What happened in there
was my way of saying

381
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:17,738
I know I've been going about
this whole thing the wrong way.

382
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:19,823
<i>(man) We've got a man down!</i>

383
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:22,868
<i>- I'm trying to make amends.
- (man) We need some help.</i>

384
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:25,454
<i>- Bygones be bygones.
- (man) We need a doctor.</i>

385
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:30,083
- You're a mercurial man, John.
- I prefer bold.

386
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:33,587
<i>(man #2) Come on,
just keep it moving, guys. Come on!</i>

387
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:39,134
<i>- (Abruzzi) Tell me what you need from me.
- A trade.</i>

388
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:42,846
You get me a plane, and I'll get you Fibonacci.

389
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:46,933
<i>- (Abruzzi) What do you need a plane for?
- (Michael) I think you know.</i>

390
00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:50,520
<i>(Abruzzi) I help you, I'm in.
You know that, don't you?</i>

391
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,439
I do.

392
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:57,069
- Just gotta know the exact date and time.
- I'll tell you soon enough.

393
00:31:57,152 --> 00:32:01,698
Soon enough won't cut it. I need
to be outside before Fibonacci testifies.

394
00:32:01,782 --> 00:32:03,408
You will be.

395
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:08,080
- He testifies in one month.
- Then you'll be out in plenty of time.

396
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:11,708
If not, you're a corpse.

397
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:19,883
So cut the crap. Tell me the exact date and
time so I can start making the arrangements.

398
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:22,511
- I don't know if I can trust you yet.
- Why not?

399
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:25,931
Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man.

400
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:38,902
- Lewis, take these off.
- Sink, I can't do that.

401
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:42,739
Come on, man. I'm in a cage. Ten minutes.

402
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:45,116
Please.

403
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,494
It's my kid.

404
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,635
<i>(awkwardly) So, here we are.</i>

405
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,888
Yeah.

406
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:12,310
- How you been?
- You know, in trouble.

407
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:14,521
How's your mom?

408
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:19,442
- She's good.
- Hey, um...

409
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:27,200
I've been talking to the chaplain. They'd like
me to decide on who I should have at the...

410
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:31,121
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

411
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:36,293
when you get to the end,
you start to realise what's important to you,

412
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:39,296
you know, who really matters to you.

413
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:46,261
And, you know, that leaves you and Mike.

414
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,972
The only blood I got left in this...

415
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:51,516
this world.

416
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,061
Yeah, I gotta say,
I'm not really following what you're saying.

417
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:57,397
Well, uh...

418
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:03,570
In the end, the only thing that matters is love.

419
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:09,534
Blood, family, you.

420
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:16,875
Um...

421
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:26,843
Give me your hand.

422
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:29,262
What are you doing?

423
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:32,015
Give me your hand.

424
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:34,559
Give me your hand.

425
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:46,237
I want you to be there when...

426
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,158
I want you to be there the day before I die.

427
00:34:52,285 --> 00:34:54,537
So I can see you.

428
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:57,373
So I can hold you.

429
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,381
I...

430
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:11,096
I love you. I've always loved you.

431
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,191
This whole thing...

432
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:28,571
I don't know if I can take it.

433
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:33,076
Me either.

434
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,037
I don't have a choice.

435
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:38,832
You do.

436
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:03,231
I am so sorry.

437
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:07,235
I met with this woman today
and she knew things about Lincoln's case.

438
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:10,905
Then she just disappeared.
I think something happened to her.

439
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:14,284
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

440
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:18,329
Do you want to get married or not?

441
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,210
I don't know.

442
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,129
Wonderful.

443
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:33,219
Maybe we could postpone it. I can't do this
right now. It's supposed to be a celebration...

444
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:37,640
If you're really telling me
you want to postpone this thing,

445
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:40,476
then I want to cancel it.

446
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:47,400
Sebastian,

447
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:50,278
I'm sorry.

448
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:54,741
I'll come and get my stuff tomorrow.

449
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:28,608
<i>(Bellick) Open on 40.</i>

450
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:33,363
Scofield.

451
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:35,448
Found you a new cellie.

452
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:39,577
I found him in psych ward.
You were the only guy with an empty tray.

453
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,828
Psych ward?

454
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:43,373
You got a problem with that?

455
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:48,503
Cos if you do, please feel free
to drop it into my suggestion box here.

456
00:37:57,345 --> 00:37:59,347
Haywire, get in here.

457
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,562
Close it up on 40.

458
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,320
Oh, and, Scofield, just a heads-up,

459
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,323
don't make eye contact with him.

460
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:46,602
Lincoln, we have a problem.
I got a new cellmate.

461
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:48,646
Who?

462
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:53,234
- That's a problem.
- We'll just have to bring him on board.

463
00:38:53,317 --> 00:38:57,321
- You don't bring a guy like that on board.
- I'll work when he's sleeping.

464
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:59,240
Ten feet, Scofield.

465
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:09,959
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

466
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,753
I thought you said
the margin for error was zero days.

467
00:39:12,837 --> 00:39:14,922
I did.

468
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:44,035
Ah!

469
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:45,703
Nice out here.

470
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:48,831
I got a buddy who's got a place
way back up in these woods.

471
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:51,584
Come up here hunting
around this time of year.

472
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,337
Man.

473
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,881
<i>(muffled yells)</i>

474
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:59,175
Back in. Back in.

475
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:05,848
Here. Come here.

476
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:09,101
- Take her out there.
- She's nothing.

477
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:13,272
Nobody would believe her
if she talked, anyway.

478
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:16,484
A hundred yards or so should do it.

479
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:19,737
Do it.

480
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,697
Go!

481
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:35,753
<i>(muffled cries)</i>

482
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:38,422
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:41,926
<i>- You gotta believe me.

484
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,845

Please!

488
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,671
Please.

489
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,934
Pick up the casings.

490
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,611
What's your problem?

491
00:42:23,694 --> 00:42:28,908
I got a neuroanatomic lesion
affecting my reticular activating system.

492
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,784
What does that mean?

493
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:33,329
It means I don't sleep.

494
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:37,082
