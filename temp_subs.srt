1
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,670
Hurry up, lads.

2
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,590
Drink up.
Five minutes to closing time.

3
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,134
Come on now.
Drink your beers.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,677
My that's a pity.
Five minutes closing time?

5
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:23,680
Five minutes to closing time.

6
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:25,140
Hello sweetheart.

7
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,226
Here's for the tune, eh.

8
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:43,492
Here, you're rotten luck,
that's what you are.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,378
Hey, you hurt bad, mate?
Let's have a look at it.

10
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,505
- Blimey.
- Ah, what can I get you, lad?

11
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,258
- Mother's Ruin.
- Make mine the same.

12
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,177
It'll cost you two bob
for the broken glass, matey?

13
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:03,971
What's the idea anyway
letting a beast like that

14
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,722
fly around loose
in a public house?

15
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,475
You didn't ought to let him
smell the blood.

16
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,811
He's very fond of blood,
Charlie is.

17
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,522
Hmm. Comes by his taste
natural if you ask me.

18
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,482
- Nobody's asking you, Miss.
- Oh.

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,109
Where's he from?

20
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:18,694
Musgrave Manor.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,530
What is this Musgrave Manor,
a blinking prison?

22
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,073
That ain't the worst
it's been called

23
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:27,327
not that I want to go about
spreading stories

24
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,663
but we knows what we knows,

25
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,331
don't we Charlie?

26
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,670
Blimey.

27
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,922
Where is this Musgrave Manor?

28
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:40,716
Down the road apiece.

29
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:44,011
You'll see it when you past
the old iron gates.

30
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,681
Only don't loiter,
you won't be welcome

31
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,933
not by the Musgraves.

32
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:51,351
Been sitting there.

33
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:54,897
Lords of the manor
ever since time was.

34
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:57,399
If those old walls
could speak

35
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,777
they'd tell you things that
raise the hair on your head.

36
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,446
There's folks hereabouts

37
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,490
swear they seen corpse lights

38
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:08,994
round the old greenhouse

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,787
and heard 'em wailing

40
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:14,041
like lost souls
in the lime rock.

41
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,501
Yeah, you want no part of it.

42
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,670
Nor the Musgraves neither,

43
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,047
hard men,

44
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,090
like them as was before them,

45
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:24,009
cruel men.

46
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:28,138
God pity 'em
for the day is coming

47
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:30,933
when they'll need pity.

48
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:13,850
I don't think you're being
quite fair, Geoffrey

49
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:17,145
I assure you
I have no wish to be fair.

50
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,316
Hmm.

51
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:25,779
An excellent specimen
of the Copris Carolina.

52
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,657
You are a sweet old soul,
aren't you?

53
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:31,743
I have no wish
to be a sweet old soul,

54
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:34,746
no wish to be anything
but what I am

55
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:37,124
a disagreeable person
who does not intend

56
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,002
to let his sister run off with
the first cock-sure Yankee

57
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:43,088
who makes her posies jump.

58
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:45,799
And I suppose Philip
feels the same way about it?

59
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,427
Well, Philip has no choice
in the matter.

60
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:49,678
As my younger brother,

61
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:52,723
Phillip feels precisely
as I tell him to.

62
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,642
Eaves dropping again, Brunton?

63
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,686
Oh, no, Mr. Phillip.
I assure you

64
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:01,023
But I didn't wish
to disturb them.

65
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,983
What did you hear, Brunton?

66
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,029
Your brother and Miss Sally

67
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,905
were going at it
hammer and tongues

68
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,532
about Captain Vickery, I mean.

69
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:11,867
Really?

70
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,369
Mr. Geoffrey
and Captain Vickery

71
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:17,748
had an horrible row
this afternoon over Miss Sally.

72
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:19,374
I thought they were
coming to blows.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,709
Indeed I did.

74
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,627
Quiet.
That will do now, Brunton.

75
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:24,212
If I catch you snooping again

76
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,965
- I shall ask my brother
to give you notice.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,759
Thank you, sir.

78
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:32,346
Your not above a bit of snooping
yourself are you Phillip?

79
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,389
Not in the least, old boy.

80
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:42,606
Brunton.

81
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:43,690
Oh, there you are.

82
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,609
I've been ringing for you.

83
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,444
Sorry, Dr. Watson.

84
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,321
I was in the upper regions.

85
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,239
The library's in a filthy mess.

86
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:52,949
The wind came swishing
down the chimney

87
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,826
and scattered the ashes
everywhere.

88
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:58,330
Very well. I'll tidy it up
at once, doctor.

89
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,879
Room full of smoke,
papers all over the floor.

90
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,172
Foul night, Brunton.

91
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,549
It's customary in Hurlstone,
sir

92
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:13,011
Just the sort of night
I'd fancy for the ghost of
Lady Torinda.

93
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,679
Oh no, Dr. Watson.

94
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:18,100
Lady Torinda only
walks in the west wing.

95
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:20,602
No one ever met a ghost
in this part of the house.

96
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:22,646
Oh really?
Isn't there some story--

97
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,731
Oh, there was a
housemaid claimed

98
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,776
that she saw
Sir Gervis Musgrave

99
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:32,572
with his head on backwards
in this very room.

100
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:33,782
Good gracious me.

101
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,867
Well, she was just a
flighty girl, sir.

102
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:37,911
It sounds like it...
very flighty.

103
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,413
Most.

104
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,299
Head on backwards,
what a bunch of rubbish.

105
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,322
I say, Brunton, does the wind
always carry on like this here?

106
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,991
Frequently sir.

107
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,534
It's a great pity.

108
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,953
It makes the gentlemen restless

109
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,749
more than usual I mean.

110
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,252
Well, our patients are all
tucked up for the night now,

111
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:29,004
hey Brunton?

112
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,548
- Are they?
- Of course, of course.

113
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,924
Well, aren't they?

114
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,677
Captain Vickery
isn't in his room, sir,

115
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:39,973
and it looked like
Major Langford I saw
going toward the pool.

116
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,893
And I can't account for
Lieutenant Clavering.

117
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,103
Oh, really?
That's very odd.

118
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,023
Very odd, sir.

119
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,107
Anything else, sir.

120
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,692
No, thank you.
Oh, yes, yes.

121
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,027
You might tell Dr. Sexton

122
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:53,487
that I'd like to see him
for a minute, will you?

123
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,197
Very good, sir.

124
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:04,414
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Brunton.

125
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:15,091
Doctor!

126
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:21,640
Get him up and let's get
him in this chair over here.

127
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,058
Sorry.

128
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,685
I'm awfully sorry.

129
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,729
- Get my bag, Brunton.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,315
Now, let's have a look.

131
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,360
Yes, near thing
just missed the carotid artery.

132
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,861
Looks like a knife wound.

133
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,571
Here you are, sir.

134
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,114
It's like a nightmare.

135
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,243
Give me some of that
cotton and bottle, will you.

136
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:44,162
- Awful nuisance.
- Oh, now, old fellow, we'll
have you patched up in no time.

137
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,081
You'll be as good as new.

138
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:46,748
What happened?

139
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:49,543
I...I don't know.

140
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,420
It was in Lime Walk just now.

141
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:54,297
I was coming up
from the village.

142
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:55,674
I remember distinctly

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,802
I was approaching
the greenhouse.

144
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,470
The wind was terrific.

145
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,722
I had to fight my way.

146
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,849
I hadn't the slightest warning.

147
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,520
All I know is that

148
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:11,690
he struck and
then I went down.

149
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:14,276
He must have thought
that I was done for.

150
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:17,279
- Any idea who it was?
- No.

151
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,699
- Well, that is I--
- Yes, yes.

152
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,576
Really I...

153
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,994
I haven't any right.

154
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,665
You have every right,
Dr. Sexton.

155
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,375
As head of this house,

156
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,420
I shall arrange for an
immediate investigation.

157
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,963
I'd rather not
if you don't mind, sir.

158
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,256
Dr. Sexton,

159
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,841
the fact that my
brother and sister and I

160
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,385
have opened our home
to convalescent patients

161
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:44,264
doesn't relieve us of all
responsibility for what occurs in it.

162
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,975
I mean, under the
peculiar circumstances.

163
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:50,353
Oh, come along, Bob.
There's no need to shield anyone.

164
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:58,945
Thirteen.

165
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,823
Thirteen, that's curious.

166
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,491
What's got into the old clock?

167
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,910
Nothing, nothing at all.

168
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,287
Oh, sir.

169
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,664
Don't you remember
the last time it did that

170
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,083
your father was killed
the next day?

171
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,449
Mr. Holmes.
Mr. Holmes.

172
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,409
Mr. Holmes.

173
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,957
Oh, Mr. Holmes, I...
Oh I...oh--

174
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,043
A purely scientific experiment,
Mrs. Hudson.

175
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:57,837
Oh, frightening the wits
out of honest people.

176
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,381
Permit me, ma'am.

177
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,550
Oh dear,

178
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:05,720
so now it's bullet holes
in me plaster.

179
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,556
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
this is the last straw.

180
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,642
The last straw, Mrs. Hudson,

181
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:13,311
the one which breaks the
back of the case against
Jacob Dillery.

182
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,522
It proves beyond
a shadow of doubt that

183
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,315
even bound as he claims he was

184
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,484
he could still have fired the
shot in his own defense

185
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,819
that killed his wife's lover.

186
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:24,531
But shooting holes
in my beautiful plaster.

187
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,782
Shh.

188
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,790
Come in, Watson.

189
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,835
My dear fellow,
I'm glad to find you in.

190
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,211
I didn't even knock.

191
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,380
How did you know
it was me...I?

192
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,840
Me is acceptable, Watson,

193
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,675
unless, of course,
you're a purist, which I doubt,

194
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,053
and may I add that your step
is like no other in London.

195
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,304
You're just in time
for breakfast.

196
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,056
Good, I rather counted on that.

197
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,766
Mrs. Hudson, dear,
how are you?

198
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,309
Oh, it's good to
see you again, sir.

199
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:55,311
I think they'll be enough
there for two.

200
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:58,064
Splendid.

201
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,482
You're a sight for sore eyes,
Watson.

202
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,359
Thanks, old boy,
and so are you.

203
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,445
- Sit down.
- Good, thank you.

204
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,822
All right let's have it.

205
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:08,867
What brings you from
Northumberland at this early hour?

206
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:12,203
Bad business, Holmes,
very bad business.

207
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,164
How did you know that I
came from Northumberland?

208
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,082
Elementary, my dear Watson.

209
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,543
You're overnight bag carried
the fresh Houston label.

210
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,171
The only train arriving at
Houston Station at this hour

211
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,423
is the New Castle Express
from Northumberland.

212
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,050
Ergo this night, thou
cometh from Northumberland.

213
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,553
- Of course. Obvious, isn't it?
- Quite.

214
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,138
Now tell me,

215
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:31,681
what dark deed was done at
Hurlstone Towers last night?

216
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,933
Well, that's what I came
to see you about, Holmes.

217
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,270
About ten o'clock last night
I was sitting in the lib--

218
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,606
How did you know that
I came from Hurlstone?

219
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,815
You wrote me that
you volunteered

220
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:42,192
for medical service
within the realm.

221
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:43,443
With your experience

222
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,320
what post could have been
offered to you

223
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,822
other than to put you in charge of
a home of convalescent officers?

224
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,324
Only one such home
has been opened

225
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,867
in Northumberland
in the last month

226
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:54,204
and that's Musgrave Manor
at Hurlstone.

227
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,622
Simple reasoning,

228
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,290
a child could do it.

229
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,834
- Not your child, Watson.
- No, of course--

230
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,836
What?
I never had a child.

231
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,463
I very nearly did though.

232
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,549
Did I ever tell you about
that widow at Twickenham?

233
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,092
A very narrow escape.

234
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,011
I just found out in time

235
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,471
that she had the most horrible little
squirt about three and a half.

236
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,598
Yes, Watson. I think we better
stick to Hurlstone.

237
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:15,850
Oh, sorry, old boy?
Oh Hurlstone.

238
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:18,311
It's a grim old pile,
very spooky.

239
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,104
Don't tell me that
you met a ghost.

240
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,357
Well, not so spooky as that.

241
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,610
Ghosts don't stab people
in the neck do they?

242
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,488
Or do they?

243
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,199
Not well-bred ghosts, Watson.

244
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,659
Who was stabbed in the neck?

245
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,453
My young assistant, Dr. Sexton.

246
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,205
- When?
- Last night.

247
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,540
Any idea who did it?

248
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,749
I have no idea.

249
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,168
- You reported it?
- Well, no, no I didn't.

250
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,253
Why not?

251
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,546
Well you see is it--

252
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,422
My dear fellow,
what you're trying to say is

253
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,716
the officers in your care
are all fine fellows,

254
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,718
wonderful war records
and so on. Is that it?

255
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,345
Precisely.

256
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,515
- So you thought perhaps
a private investigation.
- Exactly.

257
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,433
Very right and proper thinking,
Watson.

258
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,811
We're just in time to
catch the nine thirty train
for Hurlstone.

259
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:03,398
- But my dear fellow,
there's no immediate hurry.
- Isn't there?

260
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,900
Your patients are all
victims of combat fatigue.

261
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:08,444
Any one of them might go
over the edge at any moment

262
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,238
and from what you've told me

263
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:12,323
there's a killer loose
at Hurlstone.

264
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,033
Great Scott,
you may be right.

265
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,412
Come along, Watson.
We haven't a moment to lose.

266
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,080
I only hope we shan't
be too late.

267
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,385
You were right, Watson,
about Musgrave Manor.

268
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,512
Houses like people
have definite personalities

269
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:37,056
and this place is
positively ghoulish.

270
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,683
It certainly is.

271
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,060
Hello.

272
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,645
What's that?

273
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,481
- Just the old greenhouse.
- No, no, that pile of leaves.

274
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,901
Just an ordinary
pile of leaves. Why?

275
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,777
Doesn't it strike you
as odd, Watson,

276
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,195
that a pile of leaves
should be raked up

277
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:54,198
in front of a
greenhouse door?

278
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:56,618
No gardener in the world
would do that.

279
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:09,380
Geoffrey Musgrave.

280
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:34,530
That's all very interesting,
Inspector Lestrade,

281
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:37,492
but what, may I ask,
does it prove?

282
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,869
What I'm trying to prove
is this,

283
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:42,997
- that Dr. Sexton here
went down...
- That's twice now, inspector.

284
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,707
- He was stunned.
- Naturally.

285
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,917
He went out longer
than you thought.

286
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:47,502
- That's the point.
- What point?

287
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:49,128
Just this.

288
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,546
The man who attacked him had
time to get back in the house

289
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,091
- before Dr. Sexton here
came to.
- Yes?

290
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:54,133
Yes.

291
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,260
And this here glove--

292
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:58,972
Oh, and this here glove

293
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,432
what I picked up at
the scene of the crime,

294
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,477
belongs to a certain party
right here in this house.

295
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,979
I say.

296
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,231
- Well that glove
belongs to my brother.
- Huh?

297
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,733
Do you suggest that he
intended to murder Dr. Sexton?

298
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,652
Who knows?

299
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,696
The man whose hand
fits this here glove

300
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:16,239
will bear a talking to.

301
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:18,449
Very well. My brother's
down at the stables.

302
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:20,284
- I'll take you to him myself.
- Thank you.

303
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:22,704
It's the quickest way
to put a stop to this
blithering nonsense.

304
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,997
Come on.

305
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,540
- Oh, Mr. Phillip,
- Yes.

306
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,917
better not go out in
the night air without a coat.

307
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,003
- Here, take mine.
- Thanks.

308
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:34,674
Well, I won't need this.

309
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,802
No, oh, nor this.

310
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,637
Well, shall we go?

311
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,182
Why if it ain't Mr. Holmes?

312
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:44,517
Good evening, Lestrade.

313
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,810
Come to give us a hand,
have you?

314
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,270
Always happy to help,
inspector.

315
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,147
Thanks but I don't think
I shall be needing any.

316
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,193
Why if it isn't Dr. Watson.

317
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,071
Gentlemen, this is my friend,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

318
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:59,032
Mr. Phillip Musgrave
and Dr. Sexton.

319
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,491
- How do you do?
- How do you do.

320
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,994
I'll just put him up to
spend a few days with us.

321
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,495
That's very good of you

322
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,706
but as you see Scotland Yard's
already taken charge.

323
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,666
Oh really?
That's most unfortunate.

324
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,460
If you don't mind,
Dr. Watson,

325
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,795
I'd like to have a little talk
with your brother, sir.

326
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,090
- I'm afraid you can't have
that pleasure, inspector.
- Oh no?

327
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:18,259
I've got bad news for you,
Mr. Musgrave.

328
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,928
We've just found your brother
in the lime walk.

329
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,930
He's dead.

330
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:25,808
You can't mean it.

331
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,351
No.

332
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,023
Look here, Holmes, if this is
one of your little jokes.

333
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,776
Murder's no joke,
inspector.

334
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,987
That's right, Mr. Holmes.
Nobody's saying it ain't.

335
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,614
Murder?
Well let's get going.

336
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,491
- I'll take charge now.
- What?

337
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,326
But it's quite within my rights
as a local justice of the peace.

338
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:44,952
I'll come with you.

339
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,683
Wait a minute, you fool.

340
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,602
Don't go barging in like that.

341
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,479
Don't maul me.

342
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:16,567
Surgical instruments.

343
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:19,028
You know Watson,
the instruments that save life

344
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,364
are hardly more pleasant to look
at than those that take it.

345
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,490
Hmm.

346
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:23,866
Grisly thought, Holmes.

347
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:28,955
You rang, Dr. Watson?

348
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,581
Yes, Brunton.

349
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,166
I want you to take some men
and go down to the lime walk.

350
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:35,670
Me, sir, well I can't sir.
I'm sorry but I simply can't.

351
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,797
My stomach, you know.

352
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,884
I really couldn't
look at a corpse.

353
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,928
- Corpse?
- Well I--

354
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,013
How did you know
that there was a corpse?

355
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,015
Obviously, he was listening
at the door.

356
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,184
I'll take care of
the matter, doctor.

357
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,228
I was listening too.

358
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,147
Come along, Brunton.

359
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,362
Remarkable woman.

360
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,447
Housekeeper, I suppose.

361
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,116
She's very efficient.

362
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,743
Same type as Marianne Carpenter,
the trunk murderess.

363
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,581
Extraordinary house.

364
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,791
Yes, it's is indeed.

365
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,376
Now Watson,
if you don't mind

366
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,004
I'd like to have a word with
your extraordinary patients.

367
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,130
Let me remind you, Holmes,

368
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:22,466
that my patients are
just patients.

369
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:23,634
Quite so.

370
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,846
All normal men,
sound in mind and body

371
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,182
- and no sign of
psychoneurosis.
- I quite understand.

372
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,186
Then Holmes even normal people
are sometimes a little--

373
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,355
Precisely.

374
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:47,283
Hello, Mack.

375
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,621
Oh, I must have taken
a wee nap.

376
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,539
Mack, I want you to meet
a very old friend of mine,

377
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,208
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Captain Mackintosh.

378
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,292
How do you do?

379
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:57,919
I have heard of you,
Mr. Holmes.

380
00:18:58,045 --> 00:19:00,129
- Sorry to have wakened you.
- Oh, that's quite all right.

381
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,547
- See you later.
- Yes.

382
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,507
Sit down Mack and
go on with your sleep.

383
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,725
Poor chap. He lay wounded
in a trench on Josher Hill.

384
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,560
The German tanks
went over him.

385
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:18,481
- Watson?
- Huh?

386
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,608
Have you any idea how
Jeffery Musgrave met his death?

387
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,777
Yes,
a depressed skull fracture.

388
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:24,862
Wait, hang on a minute Holmes,
it isn't.

389
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,697
Isn't it?
Why not?

390
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:29,951
- No edema, no bleeding,
no contraction of tissue.
- Precisely.

391
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,953
The blow on the head
was delivered after death.

392
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,621
Musgrave was killed
by a sharp instrument

393
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,998
thrusted between the base of
the skull and the top vertebra.

394
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:38,000
Great Scott.

395
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,710
Should we go up now?

396
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,843
- Hello, Langford.
- Oh, hello there.

397
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,554
Been away, haven't you,
haven't you?

398
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,266
Yes, I just been down to London.
I brought my friend back.

399
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,142
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Major Langford.

400
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,520
Well, see you at dinner.
What...what?

401
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:58,854
I hope so.

402
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,525
I hope so. I hope so.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

403
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,529
Poor chap was at Singapore,

404
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,531
escaped from a Japanese
prison camp,

405
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,032
ghastly experience.

406
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:11,909
- He's suffering from--
- Escape complex obviously.

407
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:15,037
Yes. He's a very nice
chap, though.

408
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,455
The next fellow
I want you to meet

409
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,458
is young Clavering,
Lieutenant Royal Engineers.

410
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,545
Saw a lot of men blown to bits
by Nazi booby traps.

411
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:24,797
- He's a bit on edge.
- Not unnaturally.

412
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,637
Coming.

413
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,685
Well, Dr. Watson.
Come in, won't you?

414
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,687
Sorry to keep you so long.

415
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:41,522
You see I, uh,

416
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,025
I was lying down, resting.

417
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,694
This is my friend, Mr. Holmes,
who's here for a few days.

418
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,862
Mr. Clavering.

419
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:48,988
- Glad to meet you.
- How do you do?

420
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,157
- Sorry to disturb you.
- Not at all.

421
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,533
I say, you don't happen to have

422
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,327
some cigarettes about you,
do you?

423
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,495
That's one of the reasons I came.
I brought you some of those

424
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,123
American cigarettes
that you're so fond of.

425
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,500
It's all right, open it up.

426
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,295
No hurry, no hurry at all.

427
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,839
No, no, no.
Of course there isn't.

428
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,257
Shall we go?

429
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,134
Yes, well we must be off.
We've got a lot to do.

430
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,303
- See you later.
- Yes, I'll be back.

431
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,679
Good night.

432
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,476
He seems afraid there might
be a bomb in that package.

433
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:20,353
Well he'd find them in
less likely places than that

434
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,146
the poor chap.

435
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:24,231
The man in this room is
an American Flying officer.

436
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,192
Captain Vickery, nothing
really much matter with him.

437
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,777
What's he here for then?

438
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,987
On a rest, had a pretty
long go and he's worn out.

439
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:31,238
He needs all the rest
he can get.

440
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,993
Vickery,
Vickery.

441
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,787
He doesn't seem to be in.

442
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,334
No one at home.

443
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,919
Hmm.

444
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,754
Apparently not.

445
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,800
Not since teatime at any rate.

446
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:53,886
Hello, what's this?

447
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,846
"Captain Vickery,
here's your tea.

448
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,556
If it's cold don't blame me."

449
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,684
That sounds like
Brunton's work.

450
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,228
The butler?

451
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,480
He fancies himself a poet
but only when he's drinking.

452
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:05,815
I see.

453
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,691
Wasn't there an American killer
given to verse?

454
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:11,737
- Holmes, you don't think
that Brunton --
- Excuse me.

455
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,323
I merely stated

456
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,450
there's an American killer
given to verse.

457
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,828
Dr. Watson,
oh where are you?

458
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:20,371
Oh, there you are.

459
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:22,164
Steady my dear, steady.

460
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,999
Please make me wake up,
won't you?

461
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:26,085
It's just a bad dream,
I know,

462
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,711
- Geoff and Pat--
- Now, now, now, my dear.

463
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,505
You got to get a grip
on yourself.

464
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:32,299
Come on, come on,
come sit down.

465
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:35,928
My brother, Geoff, murdered.

466
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,180
Poor old Geoff.

467
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,975
And I hadn't spoken to him
since we had the fight
yesterday on Pat,

468
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:44,895
I mean, Captain Vickery's
account and now he's dead.

469
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:47,857
Now, now my dear you must
pull yourself together.

470
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,733
But you don't understand.

471
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,528
They're trying to say
that Pat--

472
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,447
they're trying to prove
that Pat killed Geoff.

473
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,241
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

474
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,076
Funny isn't it.

475
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:00,953
Awfully funny.

476
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,540
- Awfully funny, awfully funny!
- Stop it!

477
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,750
- Who are you?
- My name is Holmes.

478
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:09,003
- Sherlock Holmes?
- Yes.

479
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,464
Then you'll help us, won't you
Mr. Holmes, Pat and me.

480
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,840
I'll try to.

481
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,675
Now tell me,
wasn't there bad blood

482
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,260
between your brother,
Geoffrey and Captain Vickery?

483
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:17,428
That's got nothing
to do with it.

484
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:18,846
It may have everything
to do with it.

485
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,347
If you think Captain Vickery
ever murdered anyone

486
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,224
you're no more of a
detective than,

487
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,060
- than Dr. Watson.
- Oh, my dear.

488
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,062
Oh, I'm sorry.

489
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,192
You're very much in love,
aren't you?

490
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:33,402
I'm out of my mind,
Mr. Holmes.

491
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:35,905
I'm out of my mind.

492
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,657
Oh, please forgive me
and please, please help me.

493
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:40,242
Of course, of course
I understand.

494
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:41,744
But you don't understand,

495
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,287
that appalling man from
Scotland Yard

496
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,789
is questioning Pat
at this very moment.

497
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,209
Now this here rake,

498
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,085
it's the identical one you got
from the garden this afternoon,

499
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:51,670
now ain't it?

500
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,549
It smells like it.

501
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,259
Hey what is this? Are you trying
to prove that Geoffrey Musgrave

502
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:58,302
was killed with a rake?

503
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,095
No, I'm try--

504
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,306
never mind
what I'm trying to prove.

505
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:03,849
Just incriminate yourself,
Captain Vickery.

506
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,226
That's all Lestrade wants.

507
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:07,019
I'll thank you to
keep out of this, Mr. Holmes.

508
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,145
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

509
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:09,271
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

510
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:10,356
He's promised to help you, dear.

511
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,649
There's nothing to
worry about now.

512
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,984
Only his neck, miss.
Let me see your rake.

513
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,528
What do you say
you were using it for?

514
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,072
I told you. I got it to fish
my cap out of the pond.

515
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,532
It blew in.

516
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,784
Oh, so you were using it
down at the pond, were you?

517
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,619
For the tenth time, yes.

518
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,412
And how did it happen
to turn up alongside
Musgrave's body, eh?

519
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:28,165
- I don't know.
- Uh-huh, Well that's that.

520
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,792
Oh, Mr. Holmes.

521
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,752
Any fingerprints
on the rake, inspector?

522
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,587
No, Mr. Holmes.
That's the point.

523
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:36,131
If Vickery here was only using
it to fish his hat out

524
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:38,634
well now he wouldn't bother
to wipe his fingerprints off
now would he?

525
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,927
It's beyond imagination,
I suppose,

526
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:41,095
that somebody else
could have used the rake

527
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,055
and wiped off both sets
of fingerprints.

528
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,474
Highly interesting
but very unlikely.

529
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,560
Now you admit
that you had a regular set to

530
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,353
with Jeffrey Musgrave
yesterday, didn't you?

531
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,771
You threatened to
bash his head in.

532
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,606
I merely made the offer.
He didn't accept it.

533
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:53,774
- Who told you so?
- He did.

534
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Oh, no, he did.

535
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,027
I only stated what I heard.

536
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,196
Captain Vickery did
threaten my brother.

537
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:02,199
That's right, Mr. Holmes and
it's no good saying it ain't.

538
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:04,618
This Yankee lad had
motive and opportunity

539
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:07,830
and the rake ties him
right up tight to the corpse.

540
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:10,457
All right.
Come along.

541
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:16,213
Do you really think he
killed old Musgrave?

542
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:18,007
You know very well he didn't.

543
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,883
Stop clicking those needles.

544
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,969
- Oh, Pat.
- Take it easy, Sally.

545
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:23,554
Now look, don't worry a bit.

546
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,181
I'll tell you everything's
gonna be all right.

547
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,933
Let's go, inspector.

548
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,732
Mr. Holmes.

549
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:36,483
Steady.
Steady.

550
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,694
- Aren't you on our side?
- Yes, Sally.

551
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,112
Then why don't you
do something.

552
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,655
Because Captain Vickery
will be much safer

553
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,073
in the local police station
tonight

554
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,283
than he would be in this house.

555
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,410
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
what am I going to do?

556
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:47,786
Watson, get your sedative.

557
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:48,746
I'll get it at once.

558
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:50,539
Come along, Sally.

559
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:04,428
She's a bit upset
but she'll get over it.

560
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:06,221
You think so?

561
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,348
She'll have to.

562
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,849
She's got an ordeal
ahead of her.

563
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:11,852
She has to go through
that tiresome ritual tomorrow.

564
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:14,063
Ritual?

565
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:16,732
This is an old family ceremony,
Mr. Holmes.

566
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:21,236
Sally's next in line now that
I'm head of the household.

567
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:24,239
Blast this thing.

568
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:25,949
Does this help?

569
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:28,118
Oh yes, thanks.

570
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:29,953
Knitting needle, isn't it?

571
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,330
Yes.

572
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,083
Handy little things.

573
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,752
As my heir. Sally has to
recite a sort of formula

574
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,921
over Geoff's body
in front of the fireplace

575
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:42,216
and the library in the presence
of the entire household.

576
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:44,385
There, that's better.

577
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:46,887
Just what sort of formula?

578
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:48,097
Oh, it's some
meaningless words,

579
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,057
Musgrave ritual, they call it.

580
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:53,644
It's an old family custom been
handed down for generations.

581
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,814
- Can you remember the words?
- No, no, not at all.

582
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,609
But you had to speak them when
you're brother Geoffrey took over.

583
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,946
Yes, that's right, I did.

584
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,864
Let me see now.

585
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,368
"Who first shall find it
were better dead

586
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,746
Who next shall find it
perils his head.

587
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:16,333
The last to find it
defies dark powers."

588
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:22,005
"Who first shall find it
were better dead.

589
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:25,843
Who next shall find it
perils his head.

590
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:29,555
The last to find it
defies dark powers

591
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,100
and brings good fortune
to Hurlstone Towers.

592
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:37,187
Where was the light
on the face of the messenger?

593
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:38,897
Where did he speed?

594
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,816
To guard the queen's page.

595
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:52,119
Walked home in advanced
the bishop's page brashly

596
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:56,749
and who to repel,
the king's cautious page.

597
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,168
What then the--

598
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,091
disaster

599
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:11,722
queen slaughter's page."

600
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:14,516
No, no.
Sorry, Miss Sally.

601
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:17,936
"Page slaughters Page."

602
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:19,563
Thank you, Brunton.

603
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,821
"Who came then to slay him?

604
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:30,157
The bloodthirsty bishop.

605
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:32,201
Where shall he go?

606
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:34,286
Deep down below.

607
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,376
Away from the thunder,

608
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:44,171
let him dig under."

609
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:01,563
Once more into the breach,
dear friends,

610
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,232
once more.

611
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:08,362
Happy day.

612
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:13,450
You drunken sot.

613
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:15,619
The master's been ringing you
for the past ten minutes.

614
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:17,037
Why don't you answer it?

615
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:19,706
Fly away, little gremlin.

616
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,916
You're the one that'll fly away

617
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,417
if he ever catches you
in this state.

618
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,213
My sir, it's him.
Hurry, hurry.

619
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,924
Coming, sir.
Coming.

620
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,054
One moment, sir.

621
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:46,525
Mr. Holmes,
come in, sir, come in.

622
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,240
This is indeed an honor.

623
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:58,954
I don't often have visitors.

624
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,914
What can I do for you, sir?

625
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,208
You might stop that
squeaking to begin with.

626
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,626
Yes, sir.

627
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:05,669
And perhaps you can tell me
how you come to know

628
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,087
the Musgrave ritual
by heart.

629
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:09,381
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

630
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,174
When Miss Sally forgot
the lines today

631
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:13,802
you were the one
who prompted her.

632
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,762
Well, sir I memorized it.

633
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:18,473
Obviously but why?

634
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,435
Because it has no meaning.

635
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:25,147
I love things
that have no meaning.

636
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,066
Thank you, Brunton.

637
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,860
But supposing it did
have a meaning

638
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,069
and suppose that meaning
were tied up

639
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,946
with a murder of
Geoffrey Musgrave.

640
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:37,200
Oh, what a lovely idea
if I may say so.

641
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:38,702
You may, Brunton.

642
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:40,537
You may also sit down.

643
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:42,164
Thank you, sir.

644
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:50,297
Oh stop it,

645
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:51,840
and look at me.

646
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:54,092
No, here.

647
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:56,261
You know the meaning
of the Musgrave ritual.

648
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,971
- Do I?
- Well, don't you?

649
00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:01,934
You'd be surprised
at all the things I know.

650
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,518
What things?

651
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,854
- No you don't.
- About the Musgraves?

652
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,522
That would be telling.

653
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,566
But here's to them anyway

654
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:13,320
all the Musgraves
past and present,

655
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:17,324
some of 'em were murderers
and some of 'em worse

656
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,035
but they all knew
how to keep a secret

657
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,204
and so do I.

658
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,164
Brunton.

659
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:31,004
I've been ringing for you
for the past ten minutes.

660
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,383
Sorry, sir but the buzzer
doesn't buzz.

661
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,719
That'll do, Brunton.

662
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,180
You have your notice.
Do you understand?

663
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:41,306
Yes, sir.

664
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,641
Is that advisable,
Mr. Musgrave?

665
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,518
Let me be the judge of that.

666
00:31:44,644 --> 00:31:46,979
- He leaves Hurlstone
in the morning.
- The morning's a long way off.

667
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,691
Farewell,

668
00:31:50,817 --> 00:31:55,070
a long farewell
to all my greatness.

669
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,531
You've done it now,
Al Brunton.

670
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:59,700
After all we've been through.

671
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:02,369
How could I of managed
to do it all alone?

672
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:05,205
What are you going to do?

673
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:07,958
What am I going to do?

674
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:53,628
Thirteen again.

675
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,756
Yes.

676
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,360
Howells whole attitude
confuses me, Watson.

677
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,571
She swears that she hasn't
set eyes on Brunton since night

678
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,823
and yet she seems completely
unwilling to help us find him.

679
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,034
Quite so, she knows where
he is as well as we do,

680
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,203
- I mean as well as we don't.
- I wonder.

681
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:28,330
You said that he was
drinking last night.

682
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,624
Wouldn't it be a good idea
to try the pub?

683
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,042
Exactly where we're
headed for, Watson.

684
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:33,460
I'm glad we thought of it

685
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,670
even if we don't find Brunton.

686
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:40,842
I was afraid we
couldn't find him here.

687
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:43,261
Don't worry, old boy.
I could do with a drink.

688
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,181
For your information
so could I.

689
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:47,849
- Gentlemen.
- Well hello, doctor.

690
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,559
Not looking for us are you,
are you?

691
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:52,437
Well no. As a matter of fact
we're looking for--

692
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,522
Brunton.

693
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:54,731
You haven't seen him,
have you?

694
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:56,650
Have we Clavering,
have we?

695
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:59,069
Why should we?

696
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,695
- Morning, Gracie.
- Morning, doctor.

697
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:01,780
What do you have?

698
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,281
A bottle of Bass
and what's yours?

699
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,283
- A pint of bitter, please.
- And a pint of bitter.

700
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:08,203
I'm a devil. I'm a devil.

701
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:10,455
Oh really?

702
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,999
Hello.
A tame raven.

703
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:15,460
You're a devil are you,
a kettle are you?

704
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,671
I'm a devil.
I'm a devil.

705
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:19,506
Birds of prey, aren't they?

706
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:21,675
Yes, in a way,
scavengers rather.

707
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,301
They can smell a carcass
a half a mile off.

708
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,053
Yeah, that they can and all.

709
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,388
You should see Charlie here

710
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:29,307
when there's a tasty bit
outside in the street.

711
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,059
Shall we go sit down?

712
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,248
Gracie, have you seen
Dr. Watson?

713
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:55,709
- He's over there, lass.
- Thank you.

714
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,629
May I speak to you a moment,
Mr. Holmes?

715
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,548
- What's wrong, Sally?
- We can't find my brother
Phillip.

716
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:02,924
Did you look in his room?

717
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,176
That's the trouble,
we had to force the door.

718
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,094
- It was locked on the inside.
- Really?

719
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,972
- Yes. Oh, you must come,
Mr. Holmes.
- Certainly, Sally, at once.

720
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:16,855
Do be quick something ghastly
has happened. I know it.

721
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,940
And that dreadful bird,
please swat it away.

722
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,735
Watson, take her away.

723
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,028
Away, where to?

724
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,071
Anywhere. Into the pub.
Just take her away.

725
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,958
Phillip Musgrave.

726
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:45,675
What are they doing now,
doing now?

727
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,346
I don't know.
They stopped talking.

728
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:52,349
Somebody's walking about
in the upper hall,

729
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,892
heavy footsteps.

730
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,610
There's no doubt about it,
Watson.

731
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:06,404
Phillip Musgrave had a visitor
here last night.

732
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,448
These footprints were made
either by a very heavy man

733
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,158
or a man carrying
a very heavy burden.

734
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,744
That's right, Mr. Holmes.
It's no good saying it ain't.

735
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,871
The burden was
Phillip Musgrave's body

736
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:17,832
and these here footprints
were made by Alfred Brunton.

737
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:21,378
- It doesn't necessarily
follow.
- Oh, don't it.

738
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:27,425
Here,
try that on your footprint.

739
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,099
And that's
Alfred Brunton's shoe.

740
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,059
- Fits perfectly, inspector.
- Uh-huh.

741
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:37,811
But the fact that these prints
were made by Brunton's shoes

742
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:39,479
doesn't prove that Brunton's
feet were in them.

743
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:42,023
Why not? Where should Brunton's
feet be if not in his own shoe?

744
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:44,067
Well they're not in them now,
are they?

745
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:46,528
- Look here, Holmes.
Let's use our intellect.
- Your what?

746
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:47,862
What's wrong with that.

747
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:49,447
Let's stick to motive.
That's my strong point.

748
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:51,533
Now this here Brunton
had motive.

749
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:53,660
Phillip Musgrave gave
him the sack, didn't he?

750
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:55,578
Did Geoffrey Musgrave
also gave him the sack?

751
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,289
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything.

752
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,332
The similarity of method
in both murders

753
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,583
shows they were the work
of one man.

754
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,585
Well that leaves Vickery out.

755
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:03,920
- He was in jail at the time
of this murder.
- All right, Watson. All right.

756
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:06,798
Alfred Brunton's our man,
just what I said.

757
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,633
What possible motive
could Brunton have had

758
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,093
for the murder of
Geoffrey Musgrave?

759
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,178
Motive. Oh, bother motive.
Who cares about motive.

760
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:14,848
- This case is as
simple as A, B, C.
- Is it?

761
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,141
Then perhaps you can
explain to us

762
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,101
why these footprints
lead up to a blank wall

763
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:19,394
and never return.

764
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,854
What?

765
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,522
You didn't think of that,
did you inspector?

766
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:26,276
- There's just one
possible explanation.
- I've got it.

767
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:29,738
Brunton murdered Musgrave
right up against the wall.

768
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,033
He hoisted the body over
his shoulder like this you see,

769
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,826
walks backwards
clean out of the room--

770
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:40,040
That's a very undignified
position, Lestrade.

771
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,666
Upsy daisy.

772
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:44,586
In a house as old as this

773
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,629
it's not unusual to
find secret passageways

774
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:48,340
that lead down
through the walls.

775
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,383
Hello, here we are.

776
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:53,345
No you don't,
Come out of there.

777
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:01,770
What are you doing in there?

778
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,355
- None of your business.
- Answer me.

779
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,814
Obviously, she was
looking for Brunton.

780
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,399
That's right.

781
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,026
He hasn't left Musgrave Manor.
I'm certain of that, sir.

782
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,819
His clothes are still hanging
in the wardrobe.

783
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:11,363
Don't you lie to me, woman.

784
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,781
You've got him hidden
in there somewhere.

785
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:13,740
Don't go in there?

786
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:14,491
Why not?

787
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:15,408
You'll get lost.

788
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:18,286
Me lost?
Oh, I like that.

789
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:20,205
- He will get lost, sir.
- Let him.

790
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,873
Now listen to me.

791
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,875
Where did you enter
that passageway?

792
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,127
- Through the old greenhouse
in lime walk, sir.
- Did Brunton know that?

793
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:28,505
- No, he didn't.
- Mrs. Brunton,

794
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:30,215
then why were you
looking for him in there?

795
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,841
We...I--

796
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:34,677
Yes, we've known all along that
you were married to Brunton.

797
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:37,055
- You know Phillip Musgrave
was murdered, don't you?
- No.

798
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,099
- Yes, you do and you think
Brunton did it.
- No.

799
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,101
- You think he carried him down
through the greenhouse--
- No, no.

800
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:42,769
- Over to the garage--
- No, he never.

801
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:44,396
And crammed his body into the
rumble seat of that roadster.

802
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,855
Don't you try and
put the blame on Alfr--

803
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:47,607
I'll put the blame on
both of you.

804
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,025
You're in this together.

805
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,735
You were in his room last
night, I saw you there.

806
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,946
Only to talk about
the ritual, sir.

807
00:38:53,072 --> 00:38:54,656
He...we,

808
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:57,033
he thought that he'd
got it all worked out.

809
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:00,120
- Did he leave any notes,
any record?
- No, that is--

810
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:03,415
Oh come on, come on,
out with it.

811
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,083
Only this, sir.

812
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,710
I found it this morning under
the soap dish on his washstand.

813
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:08,920
Hmm.
Hastily written.

814
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,672
- Another jingle?
- Yes.

815
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:14,134
Obviously in some agitation.

816
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,011
"If any harm should come to me
fleshly or spiritual

817
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,722
seek and you will find the key
in the Musgrave ritual."

818
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,808
The old ritual,
there it is again.

819
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:23,268
Watson, we've got to find
that ritual. It's the key to
the whole business.

820
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,353
- Just a minute,
you can't talk to Sally.
- Why not?

821
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,022
- She's in such a state
and I had to give a hypo.
- All right, come along.

822
00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:33,987
Draw the curtains, Watson.

823
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,868
There must be a copy of that
ritual somewhere in this room.

824
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:41,035
She had to learn it,
you know.

825
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,537
Yes, you're right.

826
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:43,746
Here it is.

827
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:45,915
I doubt it.

828
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,292
- Empty.
- Quite.

829
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,043
There's only one thing to do,
search the room.

830
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,296
Not the room, Watson.
Her mind.

831
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,631
We must search her mind.

832
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:56,134
Obviously, she took
great pains to hide that paper.

833
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,094
But why should she hide it?

834
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,762
Put yourself in her place.

835
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,473
Her brother Geoffrey
was murdered.

836
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,057
The man she loves
is accused of that murder

837
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:04,976
and thrown into jail.
On top of that

838
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,936
she finds her brother,
Phillip, murdered.

839
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:08,688
What would your reactions be?

840
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,690
- Well, naturally
I should be terribly upset.
- Obviously.

841
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:11,900
Excuse me.

842
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,361
She's brought back
to this house in a state
bordering on hysteria.

843
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:17,864
She comes through that door,
goes to that desk,

844
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,449
throws on her gloves.

845
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:22,410
The first thing her eye lights
on is the Musgrave ritual.

846
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:24,537
In her mind it's tied up
with all the disasters

847
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:25,872
that have befallen Hurlstone.

848
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:27,832
She herself
may be the next victim.

849
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,292
She must hide that paper.

850
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:31,169
You're quite right,
but where?

851
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:35,507
Excuse me, sir.

852
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:38,176
Was she alone in this room
at any time

853
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,427
before you gave her the hypo?

854
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:41,429
Certainly not.
Nora was here.

855
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:44,933
- She helped her into bed
while I went for my bag.
- Good.

856
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,309
- Nora?
- Yes, sir.

857
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:47,393
When you were alone
with Miss Sally

858
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,686
what was the first thing
she did?

859
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:50,980
Well sir, she asked me
to turn down her bed

860
00:40:51,106 --> 00:40:53,566
- and lay out her nightdress.
- And what was she doing
in the meantime?

861
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,527
Let me think, sir.

862
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,612
Oh yes,
she went over to her desk.

863
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:59,864
Uh-huh. That was when she took
the ritual from this envelope.

864
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,366
What then Nora?

865
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,701
Then she asked me to step over
and draw the curtains.

866
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:05,703
Why someone's
pulled them open.

867
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:07,455
Yes, I know.
When you drew the curtains
you turned your back on her?

868
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:10,041
Sure. And it wasn't more than
two shakes of a lamb's tail.

869
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,085
Long enough.

870
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:13,711
When you were at the window
where was she?

871
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:16,089
She was sitting over here,

872
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:19,717
sitting right here
taking off her stockings.

873
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,053
Oh, but she never left the
chair. I'll kiss the book on it.

874
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,805
I've got it.

875
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,724
She must have packed that paper
under this cushion.

876
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,393
Oh.

877
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,644
She must have changed
her mind.

878
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,979
Obviously.

879
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:34,190
Well she could have
hidden it anywhere here.

880
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,322
What time was it when you
brought her in here, Watson?

881
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:43,074
I haven't the faintest idea.

882
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,118
The clock was striking the
quarter hour when I came in, sir.

883
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:46,828
- I definitely heard it.
- This clock?

884
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,789
- The same, sir.
- Thank you, Nora,
you may go.

885
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:52,166
Obviously this clock
was running at twelve fifteen,

886
00:41:52,293 --> 00:41:55,712
- just as obviously it
stopped at twelve twenty.
- Huh?

887
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:58,715
When Nora turned her back
Sally reached across,

888
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:00,883
opened the clock

889
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,136
and hid the ritual in here.

890
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:05,722
- Amazing, Holmes.
- Elementary my dear, Watson.

891
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:12,812
"Where fell the light on
the face of the messenger."

892
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:19,444
"Where did he speed?
To guard the queen's Page."

893
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,195
Gibberish, that's what it is.

894
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:22,989
Hokey pokey, penny a lump.

895
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:24,616
A thing like this, Watson, that's
been handed down for centuries

896
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,827
can't be mere gibberish.

897
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:31,789
"Who had entered the lists?
The king's pale knight."

898
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:32,874
Pale poppycock.

899
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,584
I say, Watson.

900
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,252
King, queen, knight, bishop.

901
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:39,172
- Sounds like a game
of chess to me.
- Precisely.

902
00:42:39,298 --> 00:42:42,050
"Where fell the light."

903
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,011
The light, Watson.

904
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:48,765
"Follow the light

905
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:50,725
on the face of a messenger."

906
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,101
Look at it, Watson.

907
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:55,146
Look at it,
like a giant chessboard.

908
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,023
This is no gibberish.

909
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:59,400
These are chess terms
and that's the chessboard.

910
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:02,195
The secret of the Musgrave murders
is locked up in that floor

911
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:04,656
and by Jove,
we've got the key to it.

912
00:43:07,743 --> 00:43:12,705
"Who had entered the lists.
The king's pale knight."

913
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:16,292
White king's knight to
white king's bishop three.

914
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:17,752
Your move, Dr. Sexton.

915
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:19,253
I really know nothing
about the game.

916
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,963
Come on, Bob.
It's great fun.

917
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,340
You start from over here.

918
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,300
Over here.
I'll show you.

919
00:43:24,426 --> 00:43:26,010
I'll show you.

920
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:30,723
One,

921
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:31,766
two,

922
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:32,934
three,

923
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,268
one.

924
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:39,649
Page to the black king three.

925
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:42,235
Your move Clavering to back
king three, please. Over there.

926
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:44,362
There's not to reason why.

927
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,789
"Page slaughters page."

928
00:43:57,543 --> 00:43:59,377
Your move, Watson.

929
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,837
I take you, my dear.

930
00:44:00,963 --> 00:44:02,130
It's a good game, isn't it?

931
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:10,430
Stop it, stop it.
You mustn't giggle.

932
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:12,473
You must be serious.

933
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:19,105
You're move, Clavering.
You take Dr. Watson.

934
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:21,149
Too bad, doctor.

935
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:30,533
"Who came then to slay him,
the bloodthirsty bishop."

936
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:34,328
White queen's bishop,
to white king's knight five.

937
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:36,080
That's my move.

938
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:46,591
One, two--

939
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,760
I say, doctor,
you moved, didn't you?

940
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,094
Did I?
I don't think so.

941
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,763
Yes, I'm afraid you did.

942
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,391
- Oh, where was I on
king bishop three?
- That's right.

943
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:58,227
Oh yes, of course.
So sorry.

944
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:02,440
Three, four, five.

945
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,358
Captain it looks bad for you.

946
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:08,362
Aye, but
where shall I go?

947
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:12,867
"Where shall he go?
Deep down below."

948
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:15,119
Mrs. Howells,
what's underneath this floor?

949
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,581
Well, it's only an old cellar, sir.

950
00:45:18,707 --> 00:45:21,667
The entrance goes
down behind that stair

951
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:24,670
but it's been locked up
for centuries.

952
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:26,130
One of the old Musgraves

953
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,174
murdered his own brother
down there.

954
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,426
Shh, listen.

955
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:33,930
Hello, what's that?

956
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,682
It's Brunton.

957
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:38,601
Alf, Alf?

958
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:41,395
He's in that passageway
over the fireplace.

959
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:42,939
Are you there, Brunton?

960
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:44,232
Get me out!

961
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:46,692
It's me, Lestrade.

962
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:48,402
I'm lost.

963
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:50,613
I'm all turned around.

964
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,240
You have been for years.

965
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:53,199
Get him out there,
will you, Mrs. Howells

966
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,867
and give him a saucer of milk.

967
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,328
Come here, Jenny.
Stand on this square for me

968
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,580
and stamp on it,
keep stamping.

969
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:00,832
Clavering, get your
sound detector.

970
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,125
Gentlemen,
deep down below.

971
00:46:23,272 --> 00:46:26,482
Look, there's not been a
soul here in a couple of
hundred years.

972
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:28,150
Someone's been here

973
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:29,819
and in the last
twenty-four hours.

974
00:46:29,945 --> 00:46:33,322
- Yeah, it's clean as a new pin.
- Precisely.

975
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,408
Dust of two hundred years
is on the walls.

976
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:36,951
The floor's been swept clean

977
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:39,370
obviously in an attempt
to remove footprints.

978
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,624
Shh, listen.

979
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,835
That's Jenny
in the hall upstairs.

980
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:53,050
Clavering,

981
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:55,011
let me have your
sound detector.

982
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:01,434
So sorry.

983
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:11,068
I must find the exact spot under
that square I marked in the hall.

984
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:19,869
Don't move, anyone.

985
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:31,797
Someone's moving about

986
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:34,050
interfering with
what I'm trying to do.

987
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:39,513
Stand perfectly still
everybody.

988
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:03,496
This is the spot.
Lend me a hand.

989
00:48:03,622 --> 00:48:04,830
Of course.

990
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,167
- Here, I'll take that.
- Oh, thanks, old fellow.

991
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,673
- Hello.
- Good gracious me.

992
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:19,053
"Here lies the body of
Ralph Musgrave, knight,

993
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:20,972
the lord of the
manors of Hurlstone."

994
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:24,100
This place used to be
known as Hurlstone Towers.

995
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:29,563
"Neverfield and King's Hargrave
Anno Domini 1539."

996
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,440
What we're looking for
is underneath here

997
00:48:31,566 --> 00:48:34,568
that's what the ritual
meant by deep down low.
It's a burial crypt.

998
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,195
Up with it.

999
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:47,790
I say, there's somebody
down there.

1000
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:49,250
Who is it?
Is it Brunton?

1001
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:50,376
Is it Brunton?

1002
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:53,004
I don't know.
Stay where you are.

1003
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,896
Who is it, Holmes?

1004
00:49:11,023 --> 00:49:12,356
It's Brunton all right.

1005
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,899
Is he dead?

1006
00:49:14,026 --> 00:49:15,526
Yes.

1007
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,570
He's been dead for hours.

1008
00:49:17,696 --> 00:49:20,364
Murdered.

1009
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,492
Hello, what's this?

1010
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,340
"Henry by the grace of god,
King of Great Britain,

1011
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:42,887
France and Ireland,
defender of the faith..."

1012
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,223
- What have you found?
- Any clue, any clue?

1013
00:49:48,143 --> 00:49:50,644
Uh, no, um...

1014
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,649
Just an old document.

1015
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,404
Hello.
What's this?

1016
00:50:04,076 --> 00:50:06,285
Looks like some sort
of writing. Watson.

1017
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:07,995
Coming.

1018
00:50:10,082 --> 00:50:11,707
Hold this for me, will you?
Steady.

1019
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,335
They're on the floor
by his right hand.

1020
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,003
See those marks in the dust

1021
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:18,756
like pin scratches made
with his fingernail?

1022
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:23,344
Yes. Yes.

1023
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,721
See that stuff under his nail?

1024
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:27,098
He was trying to
write something.

1025
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,641
By Jove!

1026
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:29,934
He did write something.

1027
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,185
What is it?

1028
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:32,978
Aye, tell us man.

1029
00:50:33,105 --> 00:50:34,605
What did he write?

1030
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,068
I can't make it out.
It's too faint.

1031
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:42,446
Here. I've got good eyes,
let me, let me.

1032
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,657
Stay where you are,
all of you.

1033
00:50:49,204 --> 00:50:53,290
These marks
must not be erased.

1034
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,251
What are you going to do,
Holmes?

1035
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:57,419
I'm going to leave
this just as it is

1036
00:50:57,546 --> 00:51:01,006
until I can get the proper
chemicals to bring out the words.

1037
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:04,552
Have you no notion of
what he tried to write?

1038
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:06,345
Yes, I have.

1039
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:10,099
I think that Brunton
with his last strength

1040
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:12,476
wrote the name of his murderer
on that floor

1041
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,395
in his own blood.

1042
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:36,917
Oh, there you are, Lestrade.

1043
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,794
Huh.
Twelve o'clock.

1044
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,504
I was just saying, Lestrade,

1045
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,423
that I should get into
New Castle,

1046
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:44,508
pick up my chemicals
and be back here not later than
noon tomorrow.

1047
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,177
- Why yes, Mr. Holmes.
- Meanwhile, you all have
your work cut out for you.

1048
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,928
- Watson.
- Yes?

1049
00:51:50,765 --> 00:51:52,141
You'll guard this door
with your life.

1050
00:51:52,267 --> 00:51:53,601
Of course I'll will.
With my what?

1051
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,352
I said with your life.

1052
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:56,437
Anything you say, Holmes.

1053
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:57,605
There's no entrance
to this cellar

1054
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:00,983
except through that doorway.

1055
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:03,611
But, Holmes what I feel--
Oh.

1056
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,154
Brunton's murderer's
in this house

1057
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,780
and he's bound to make one last
effort to get down there

1058
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:08,574
- to erase those marks.
- Naturally.

1059
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,075
Lestrade's men
are posted outside

1060
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:11,577
and they'll see to it that
nobody leaves this house.

1061
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:13,120
Concentration camp.

1062
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:15,289
My men have orders to shoot
if necessary.

1063
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:17,124
- I'll be outside myself
keeping watch.
- Good.

1064
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,335
Sexton your post will be
at Miss Sally's door

1065
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:21,503
and remember she's in more
danger than anyone here.

1066
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,547
- Don't worry I'll look after
her, Mr. Holmes.
- Good night.

1067
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,257
- Good night, Holmes.
- Good nigh.

1068
00:52:25,383 --> 00:52:28,302
Oh, Dr. Watson,
if you want any help, sing out.

1069
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:30,638
I don't mind saying I feel a
lot safer if I had a gun on me.

1070
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:33,224
Huh, I always
keep mine ready.

1071
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,149
Well, good night, Bob.
Keep awake, old man.

1072
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:43,817
I will.

1073
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:06,131
That's funny.
It's striking twelve again.

1074
00:54:11,072 --> 00:54:12,656
Let me out of here,
you hear?

1075
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,119
Let me out of here.

1076
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:19,288
Someone locked this door.

1077
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:27,421
What on earth's
all this monkey business.

1078
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:28,422
I didn't lock you in.

1079
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:29,715
Well doors don't
lock themselves.

1080
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:30,883
They do in this house.

1081
00:54:31,009 --> 00:54:32,176
What are you doing
down here anyway?

1082
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,136
- I'm worried about Langford.
- Langford?

1083
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:36,930
Yes, he's got into his head
that this is a Jap prison camp.

1084
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:38,432
He's got that filthy rope

1085
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:39,892
and he's bound and determined
to go out the window.

1086
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,436
He can't do that.
Lestrade's men will shoot him.

1087
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:44,188
He may be out already.

1088
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,814
I'll head him off.

1089
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,399
Then again he may not be.

1090
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:48,400
Perhaps you're right.

1091
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:49,693
Let me go.

1092
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,612
No, no.
You'll be shot.

1093
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:52,738
I'll go.

1094
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:53,864
No, you'll be shot.

1095
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,115
Oh really?

1096
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:57,076
Let's both go.

1097
00:54:57,202 --> 00:54:59,995
I can't leave here.

1098
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:01,330
You stay where you are.

1099
00:55:01,456 --> 00:55:03,415
I'll go and call Lestrade.

1100
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:10,089
Remember Clavering,
stay where you are.

1101
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,223
Here.

1102
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,558
Look here, Constable.
I'm Dr. Watson.

1103
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:23,477
Are you now?

1104
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:26,855
Well, I'm Mrs. Minivar.

1105
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:29,358
- Come along to the inspector.
- Gross impertinence.

1106
00:55:53,508 --> 00:55:55,050
Useless.

1107
00:55:55,176 --> 00:55:57,428
Quite useless,
I assure you.

1108
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:03,559
There's nothing written
on the floor.

1109
00:56:03,685 --> 00:56:06,854
It was just a rouse of mine to
bring Brunton's murderer here.

1110
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,355
Permit me.

1111
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,107
As the most ruthless
killer in England

1112
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,525
you deserve some of the light.

1113
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:13,318
Killer, I?

1114
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:15,946
Oh I say,
you seem to forget that my
life was also attempted.

1115
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,032
And a very neat trick it was to
divert suspicion from yourself

1116
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:21,869
but it struck me as odd
that the man who murdered
both Musgraves

1117
00:56:21,995 --> 00:56:23,537
with such a sure hand

1118
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:27,207
should have missed so badly
in your case

1119
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,919
unless of course, um,
you yourself were the murderer.

1120
00:56:31,045 --> 00:56:33,088
Ah, that's ridiculous.

1121
00:56:33,214 --> 00:56:38,635
Then too it seemed curious
that you a doctor

1122
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:40,929
examining both bodies

1123
00:56:41,055 --> 00:56:43,765
and failed to report
the real cause of death.

1124
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:45,392
And that was?

1125
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:47,769
A cisternal needle
thrust up into the brain

1126
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:50,189
between the base of the skull
and the cervical vertebrae.

1127
00:56:50,315 --> 00:56:52,900
I had the unpleasant duty of
removing this piece of a needle

1128
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:55,527
from Phillip Musgrave's head.

1129
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:57,946
It couldn't be yours
by any chance, could it?

1130
00:56:58,072 --> 00:56:59,156
I never owned one.

1131
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,116
Oh yes, you did.

1132
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:04,328
I saw it in your case

1133
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,914
the night I came
into this house

1134
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,709
just after Geoffrey Musgrave
was found murdered.

1135
00:57:10,835 --> 00:57:12,711
It wasn't broken then.

1136
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:14,296
It was only when you killed
Phillip Musgrave

1137
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:15,589
that you lost a piece of it.

1138
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:17,090
Nonsense.

1139
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:18,592
Why should I go around
sticking needles into people?

1140
00:57:18,718 --> 00:57:20,677
A fair enough question,
doctor.

1141
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:22,095
Among nice people

1142
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:25,140
murder like matrimony
generally has a motive

1143
00:57:25,266 --> 00:57:27,935
and in this case
the motive was matrimony.

1144
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:29,478
Oh, you mean Miss Sally?

1145
00:57:29,604 --> 00:57:30,729
I do.

1146
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:32,689
Oh, I see,

1147
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,608
- so you think it's a case of
murder for profit, do you.
- Precisely.

1148
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,443
My dear, Holmes.
That won't do.

1149
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:38,695
The Musgraves are land poor.
Everybody knows that.

1150
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:39,947
Exactly.

1151
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:42,574
But everybody didn't know
what you knew.

1152
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,078
You worked out the meaning
of the Musgrave ritual.

1153
00:57:46,204 --> 00:57:47,996
I have? Oh.

1154
00:57:48,122 --> 00:57:51,041
Yes.
You have.

1155
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,169
You claimed you knew nothing
about the game of chess.

1156
00:57:54,295 --> 00:57:56,880
When I suggested you'd moved
off your proper square

1157
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,007
you promptly named
king's bishop three

1158
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:00,717
and what's more
moved back onto it.

1159
00:58:00,843 --> 00:58:02,344
Oh, nonsense.

1160
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:03,428
Why shouldn't I have stepped
out of my square in the first--

1161
00:58:03,555 --> 00:58:05,013
Break up my moves,
spoil my game

1162
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:07,975
and protect me from finding
what you had already found.

1163
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:09,184
And that was?

1164
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:12,104
The old land grant
I took from this box

1165
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:15,148
which would have made
Sally Musgrave upon the
death of her brothers,

1166
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,359
the richest woman in England.

1167
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,446
Now what's that?

1168
00:58:21,573 --> 00:58:25,617
Don't tell me you found
another needle?

1169
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:30,163
No, no.
It's just a button.

1170
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,748
It wouldn't be yours,
would it?

1171
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:34,042
Mine?

1172
00:58:34,168 --> 00:58:35,502
Give it to me.

1173
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,470
Thank you.

1174
00:58:45,597 --> 00:58:46,680
Would you mind
telling me why

1175
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:47,889
you think I was down here
with Brunton?

1176
00:58:48,016 --> 00:58:49,600
No, not at all.

1177
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:53,270
As I see it you killed Phillip
Musgrave in his own room,

1178
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,731
carried his body down through
the secret passageway,

1179
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:57,649
out through the greenhouse
into the garage

1180
00:58:57,775 --> 00:59:00,444
where you crammed it into the
rumble seat of that roadster

1181
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,821
but unfortunately for you,

1182
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:05,157
you had a witness.

1183
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:09,911
Brunton was there,
sleeping off his drunk.

1184
00:59:10,038 --> 00:59:12,789
Nursing a grudge
against Phillip Musgrave.

1185
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:15,542
Brunton became your accessory.

1186
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:17,252
But you didn't want
an accessory

1187
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:20,172
so you lured him down here
with a promise

1188
00:59:20,298 --> 00:59:22,549
to share the Musgrave
treasure with him

1189
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:27,262
and exit Brunton.

1190
00:59:27,388 --> 00:59:29,056
Very ingenious, Mr. Holmes.

1191
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:30,807
You seem to have everything

1192
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:33,477
except perhaps the
negligible item of proof.

1193
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,354
Suppose we leave that
to the jury.

1194
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,272
Suppose we do.

1195
00:59:37,398 --> 00:59:38,357
Shall we go?

1196
00:59:38,483 --> 00:59:40,901
After you.

1197
00:59:41,027 --> 00:59:42,444
Oh, by the way,

1198
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,072
don't forget your torch.

1199
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:46,823
Oh, thanks.

1200
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:51,703
I don't suppose
it occurred to you

1201
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:53,246
that you were taking
a bit of a chance

1202
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:57,125
coming down here all alone
with a suspected murderer.

1203
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:59,211
One has to take chances
in my profession, doctor.

1204
00:59:59,337 --> 01:00:00,879
You see,
I couldn't possibly risk

1205
01:00:01,005 --> 01:00:02,839
sharing my little
plot with anybody.

1206
01:00:02,965 --> 01:00:04,466
Not even with Dr. Watson?

1207
01:00:04,592 --> 01:00:06,218
Particularly not with
Dr. Watson.

1208
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:07,552
If he'd known
what was up tonight

1209
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:08,720
he could have been so
elaborate and mysterious

1210
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:10,180
he'd a given
the whole show away.

1211
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,723
As a matter of fact
I had a devil's own time

1212
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:13,475
luring him away
from that door upstairs

1213
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:16,228
so that we could be alone.

1214
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:17,896
That's all I wanted to know.

1215
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:03,483
Stay where you are.

1216
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:06,319
I'm afraid I have no choice,
Dr. Sexton.

1217
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:11,324
Look here.

1218
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:14,953
You're not really
gonna kill me, are you?

1219
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:18,081
- They'll hear you.
- Who will?

1220
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,541
That was a bad slip you made

1221
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:23,170
letting me know you were
so completely alone.

1222
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:25,547
And you're really
gonna kill me?

1223
01:01:25,673 --> 01:01:31,178
I'm afraid I have no choice,
Mr. Holmes.

1224
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:33,555
As you said,

1225
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:35,766
I have no evidence against you.

1226
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,559
No proof.
No proof at all.

1227
01:01:37,685 --> 01:01:40,979
You forget the needle
and the button.

1228
01:01:41,105 --> 01:01:43,732
Bring them here, please.

1229
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:58,872
Not too close.

1230
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:01,333
Now put them in my pocket.

1231
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,797
Thank you.

1232
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,715
Curious about that button.

1233
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:11,134
It is off my coat, of course.

1234
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,929
I can't think how
I ever missed it.

1235
01:02:14,055 --> 01:02:15,472
Poor old Brunton.

1236
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,557
He didn't struggle much.

1237
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:19,851
Now Phillip Musgrave
was different.

1238
01:02:19,977 --> 01:02:23,480
The needle broke off and I didn't
have time to probe for it.

1239
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,148
But you have both
of them now,

1240
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,818
the button and the needle,
why kill me?

1241
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:33,615
Now step back just a bit.

1242
01:02:33,741 --> 01:02:38,203
Against the wall.

1243
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:40,539
Now if you stand
perfectly still

1244
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:44,000
I think I can manage this
with one shot.

1245
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:10,986
Put 'em up.

1246
01:03:12,363 --> 01:03:13,947
Did you hear his
confession, Watson.

1247
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:15,615
Every word, Holmes.

1248
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:17,826
And I heard all the rest, sir.

1249
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:19,244
Good.

1250
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,288
Let me congratulate you
on an extraordinary catch.

1251
01:03:21,414 --> 01:03:23,623
That's right, Mr. Holmes.
It's no good saying it ain't.

1252
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:25,625
I'm afraid I
underestimated you, Holmes.

1253
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:26,459
Pity.

1254
01:03:26,586 --> 01:03:28,295
Yes.

1255
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:31,006
Those blank cartridges were a
cheap sort of trick. I grant you.

1256
01:03:31,132 --> 01:03:33,133
But it wasn't easy to let you
take my gun away from me

1257
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:35,302
without seeming to
hand it to you.

1258
01:03:35,428 --> 01:03:37,053
That's why I let you take
the torch first.

1259
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:38,430
I knew you'd snap it off.

1260
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:40,807
Yes. We told you,
you were taking an awful risk.

1261
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:43,059
Well we had to have
a confession

1262
01:03:43,185 --> 01:03:45,020
and these egomaniacs are
always so much more chatty

1263
01:03:45,146 --> 01:03:46,605
when they feel
they have the upper hand.

1264
01:03:46,731 --> 01:03:48,023
Shall we go?

1265
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,986
I can't make head nor
tail of it. Can you Pat?

1266
01:03:53,112 --> 01:03:56,197
It looks like an
old land grant.

1267
01:03:56,324 --> 01:03:57,782
It's really a crown grant.

1268
01:03:57,909 --> 01:03:59,117
What I don't understand is

1269
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:01,661
why the Musgraves didn't
claim the land ages ago.

1270
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:03,246
Obviously Watson,
one of 'em died

1271
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:06,082
before passing on the meaning
of the ritual to his heir.

1272
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,959
The words remain
but the sense was lost.

1273
01:04:08,085 --> 01:04:10,420
I wonder why he left the grant
down there where he found it.

1274
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:11,922
What good would it have
done him

1275
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,590
so long as your brothers lived.

1276
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:15,425
Once they were out of the way
and you came into the property

1277
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:16,968
he expected to marry you.

1278
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:18,845
I like that.

1279
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:20,889
- Whatever made him think that
- He thought himself
irresistible.

1280
01:04:21,015 --> 01:04:22,182
Precisely.

1281
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:23,892
It's not unheard of
in cases of egomania.

1282
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:25,852
I suppose then he meant to
rediscover the crown grant.

1283
01:04:25,978 --> 01:04:27,354
At the proper time, yes

1284
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,356
and then enjoy
his wife's millions.

1285
01:04:29,482 --> 01:04:31,191
- Did you say millions?
- I did.

1286
01:04:31,317 --> 01:04:32,817
Look here.

1287
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,283
About eighty thousand acres
of the richest soil in England.

1288
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,576
But aren't there people on it?

1289
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:44,412
Yes, farms, villages,
even a factory town

1290
01:04:44,538 --> 01:04:45,789
with hundreds of
workman's cottages.

1291
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,248
- Is this thing legal?
- Perfectly.

1292
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:48,708
Of course it'll drag
on through the courts.

1293
01:04:48,834 --> 01:04:50,168
Just a moment.

1294
01:04:50,294 --> 01:04:51,795
The people on this land,

1295
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,714
they put their money into it,
their life work.

1296
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,550
- It's their homes
I'll be taking.
- Yes.

1297
01:04:57,677 --> 01:05:00,553
Do you think I'm going
to kick these people out?

1298
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,236
Just the same, Holmes

1299
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:17,904
you let poor little Sally
throw away a fortune.

1300
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,115
My dear fellow,
I had nothing to do with it.

1301
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:22,283
The girl, more power to her,
acted on her own.

1302
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:26,121
It was a grand gesture
one she may regret.

1303
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:29,082
I don't think so, Watson.

1304
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:32,252
There's a new spirit
abroad in the land.

1305
01:05:32,378 --> 01:05:35,714
The old days of grab and greed
are on their way out.

1306
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,216
We're beginning to think of
what we owe the other fellow

1307
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:41,052
not just what we're
compelled to give him.

1308
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:43,263
The time is coming, Watson,

1309
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:45,181
when we shan't be able
to fill our bellies in comfort

1310
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:46,933
while other folk go hungry

1311
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:49,269
or sleep in warm beds

1312
01:05:49,395 --> 01:05:52,063
while others shiver in the cold

1313
01:05:52,189 --> 01:05:53,648
and we shan't be able to kneel

1314
01:05:53,774 --> 01:05:57,193
and thank God for blessing us
before our shining alters

1315
01:05:57,319 --> 01:05:59,279
while men anywhere

1316
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:02,907
are kneeling
in either physical or
a spiritual subjection.

1317
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:06,953
You may be right, Holmes.
I hope you are.

1318
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:13,334
And god willing we'll live
to see that day, Watson.
