1
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,670
Hurry up, lads.

2
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,590
Drink up.
Five minutes to closing time.

3
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,134
Come on now.
Drink your beers.

4
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,677
My that's a pity.
Five minutes closing time?

5
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,680
Five minutes to closing time.

6
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,140
Hello sweetheart.

7
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,226
Here's for the tune, eh.

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,492
Here, you're rotten luck,
that's what you are.

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,378
Hey, you hurt bad, mate?
Let's have a look at it.

10
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,505
- Blimey.
- Ah, what can I get you, lad?

11
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,258
- Mother's Ruin.
- Make mine the same.

12
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,177
It'll cost you two bob
for the broken glass, matey?

13
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,971
What's the idea anyway
letting a beast like that

14
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,722
fly around loose
in a public house?

15
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,475
You didn't ought to let him
smell the blood.

16
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,811
He's very fond of blood,
Charlie is.

17
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,522
Hmm. Comes by his taste
natural if you ask me.

18
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,482
- Nobody's asking you, Miss.
- Oh.

19
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,109
Where's he from?

20
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,694
Musgrave Manor.

21
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,530
What is this Musgrave Manor,
a blinking prison?

22
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,073
That ain't the worst
it's been called

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,327
not that I want to go about
spreading stories

24
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,663
but we knows what we knows,

25
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,331
don't we Charlie?

26
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,670
Blimey.

27
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,922
Where is this Musgrave Manor?

28
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,716
Down the road apiece.

29
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,011
You'll see it when you past
the old iron gates.

30
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,681
Only don't loiter,
you won't be welcome

31
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,933
not by the Musgraves.

32
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,351
Been sitting there.

33
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,897
Lords of the manor
ever since time was.

34
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,399
If those old walls
could speak

35
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,777
they'd tell you things that
raise the hair on your head.

36
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,446
There's folks hereabouts

37
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,490
swear they seen corpse lights

38
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,994
round the old greenhouse

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,787
and heard 'em wailing

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,041
like lost souls
in the lime rock.

41
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,501
Yeah, you want no part of it.

42
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,670
Nor the Musgraves neither,

43
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,047
hard men,

44
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,090
like them as was before them,

45
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,009
cruel men.

46
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,138
God pity 'em
for the day is coming

47
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,933
when they'll need pity.

48
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,850
I don't think you're being
quite fair, Geoffrey

49
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,145
I assure you
I have no wish to be fair.

50
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,316
Hmm.

51
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,779
An excellent specimen
of the Copris Carolina.

52
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,657
You are a sweet old soul,
aren't you?

53
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,743
I have no wish
to be a sweet old soul,

54
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,746
no wish to be anything
but what I am

55
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,124
a disagreeable person
who does not intend

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,002
to let his sister run off with
the first cock-sure Yankee

57
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,088
who makes her posies jump.

58
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,799
And I suppose Philip
feels the same way about it?

59
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,427
Well, Philip has no choice
in the matter.

60
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,678
As my younger brother,

61
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,723
Phillip feels precisely
as I tell him to.

62
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,642
Eaves dropping again, Brunton?

63
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,686
Oh, no, Mr. Phillip.
I assure you

64
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,023
But I didn't wish
to disturb them.

65
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,983
What did you hear, Brunton?

66
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,029
Your brother and Miss Sally

67
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,905
were going at it
hammer and tongues

68
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,532
about Captain Vickery, I mean.

69
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,867
Really?

70
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,369
Mr. Geoffrey
and Captain Vickery

71
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,748
had an horrible row
this afternoon over Miss Sally.

72
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,374
I thought they were
coming to blows.

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,709
Indeed I did.

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,627
Quiet.
That will do now, Brunton.

75
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,212
If I catch you snooping again

76
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,965
- I shall ask my brother
to give you notice.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,759
Thank you, sir.

78
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,346
Your not above a bit of snooping
yourself are you Phillip?

79
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,389
Not in the least, old boy.

80
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,606
Brunton.

81
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,690
Oh, there you are.

82
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,609
I've been ringing for you.

83
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,444
Sorry, Dr. Watson.

84
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,321
I was in the upper regions.

85
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,239
The library's in a filthy mess.

86
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,949
The wind came swishing
down the chimney

87
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,826
and scattered the ashes
everywhere.

88
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,330
Very well. I'll tidy it up
at once, doctor.

89
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,879
Room full of smoke,
papers all over the floor.

90
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,172
Foul night, Brunton.

91
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,549
It's customary in Hurlstone,
sir

92
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,011
Just the sort of night
I'd fancy for the ghost of
Lady Torinda.

93
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,679
Oh no, Dr. Watson.

94
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,100
Lady Torinda only
walks in the west wing.

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,602
No one ever met a ghost
in this part of the house.

96
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,646
Oh really?
Isn't there some story--

97
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,731
Oh, there was a
housemaid claimed

98
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,776
that she saw
Sir Gervis Musgrave

99
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,572
with his head on backwards
in this very room.

100
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,782
Good gracious me.

101
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,867
Well, she was just a
flighty girl, sir.

102
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,911
It sounds like it...
very flighty.

103
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,413
Most.

104
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,299
Head on backwards,
what a bunch of rubbish.

105
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,322
I say, Brunton, does the wind
always carry on like this here?

106
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,991
Frequently sir.

107
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,534
It's a great pity.

108
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,953
It makes the gentlemen restless

109
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,749
more than usual I mean.

110
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,252
Well, our patients are all
tucked up for the night now,

111
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,004
hey Brunton?

112
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,548
- Are they?
- Of course, of course.

113
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,924
Well, aren't they?

114
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,677
Captain Vickery
isn't in his room, sir,

115
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,973
and it looked like
Major Langford I saw
going toward the pool.

116
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,893
And I can't account for
Lieutenant Clavering.

117
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,103
Oh, really?
That's very odd.

118
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,023
Very odd, sir.

119
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,107
Anything else, sir.

120
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,692
No, thank you.
Oh, yes, yes.

121
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,027
You might tell Dr. Sexton

122
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,487
that I'd like to see him
for a minute, will you?

123
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,197
Very good, sir.

124
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,414
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Brunton.

125
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,091
Doctor!

126
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,640
Get him up and let's get
him in this chair over here.

127
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,058
Sorry.

128
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,685
I'm awfully sorry.

129
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,729
- Get my bag, Brunton.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,315
Now, let's have a look.

131
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,360
Yes, near thing
just missed the carotid artery.

132
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,861
Looks like a knife wound.

133
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,571
Here you are, sir.

134
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,114
It's like a nightmare.

135
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,243
Give me some of that
cotton and bottle, will you.

136
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,162
- Awful nuisance.
- Oh, now, old fellow, we'll
have you patched up in no time.

137
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,081
You'll be as good as new.

138
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:01,748
What happened?

139
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,543
I...I don't know.

140
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,420
It was in Lime Walk just now.

141
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,297
I was coming up
from the village.

142
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,674
I remember distinctly

143
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,802
I was approaching
the greenhouse.

144
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,470
The wind was terrific.

145
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,722
I had to fight my way.

146
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,849
I hadn't the slightest warning.

147
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,520
All I know is that

148
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,690
he struck and
then I went down.

149
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,276
He must have thought
that I was done for.

150
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,279
- Any idea who it was?
- No.

151
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,699
- Well, that is I--
- Yes, yes.

152
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,576
Really I...

153
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,994
I haven't any right.

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,665
You have every right,
Dr. Sexton.

155
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,375
As head of this house,

156
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,420
I shall arrange for an
immediate investigation.

157
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,963
I'd rather not
if you don't mind, sir.

158
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,256
Dr. Sexton,

159
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,841
the fact that my
brother and sister and I

160
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,385
have opened our home
to convalescent patients

161
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,264
doesn't relieve us of all
responsibility for what occurs in it.

162
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,975
I mean, under the
peculiar circumstances.

163
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,353
Oh, come along, Bob.
There's no need to shield anyone.

164
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,945
Thirteen.

165
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,823
Thirteen, that's curious.

166
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,491
What's got into the old clock?

167
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,910
Nothing, nothing at all.

168
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,287
Oh, sir.

169
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,664
Don't you remember
the last time it did that

170
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,083
your father was killed
the next day?

171
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,449
Mr. Holmes.
Mr. Holmes.

172
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,409
Mr. Holmes.

173
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,957
Oh, Mr. Holmes, I...
Oh I...oh--

174
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,043
A purely scientific experiment,
Mrs. Hudson.

175
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,837
Oh, frightening the wits
out of honest people.

176
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,381
Permit me, ma'am.

177
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,550
Oh dear,

178
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,720
so now it's bullet holes
in me plaster.

179
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,556
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
this is the last straw.

180
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,642
The last straw, Mrs. Hudson,

181
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,311
the one which breaks the
back of the case against
Jacob Dillery.

182
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,522
It proves beyond
a shadow of doubt that

183
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,315
even bound as he claims he was

184
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,484
he could still have fired the
shot in his own defense

185
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,819
that killed his wife's lover.

186
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,531
But shooting holes
in my beautiful plaster.

187
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,782
Shh.

188
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,790
Come in, Watson.

189
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,835
My dear fellow,
I'm glad to find you in.

190
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,211
I didn't even knock.

191
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,380
How did you know
it was me...I?

192
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,840
Me is acceptable, Watson,

193
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,675
unless, of course,
you're a purist, which I doubt,

194
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,053
and may I add that your step
is like no other in London.

195
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,304
You're just in time
for breakfast.

196
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,056
Good, I rather counted on that.

197
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,766
Mrs. Hudson, dear,
how are you?

198
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,309
Oh, it's good to
see you again, sir.

199
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,311
I think they'll be enough
there for two.

200
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,064
Splendid.

201
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,482
You're a sight for sore eyes,
Watson.

202
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,359
Thanks, old boy,
and so are you.

203
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,445
- Sit down.
- Good, thank you.

204
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,822
All right let's have it.

205
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,867
What brings you from
Northumberland at this early hour?

206
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,203
Bad business, Holmes,
very bad business.

207
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,164
How did you know that I
came from Northumberland?

208
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,082
Elementary, my dear Watson.

209
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,543
You're overnight bag carried
the fresh Houston label.

210
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,171
The only train arriving at
Houston Station at this hour

211
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,423
is the New Castle Express
from Northumberland.

212
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,050
Ergo this night, thou
cometh from Northumberland.

213
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,553
- Of course. Obvious, isn't it?
- Quite.

214
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,138
Now tell me,

215
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,681
what dark deed was done at
Hurlstone Towers last night?

216
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,933
Well, that's what I came
to see you about, Holmes.

217
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,270
About ten o'clock last night
I was sitting in the lib--

218
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,606
How did you know that
I came from Hurlstone?

219
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,815
You wrote me that
you volunteered

220
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,192
for medical service
within the realm.

221
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,443
With your experience

222
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,320
what post could have been
offered to you

223
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,822
other than to put you in charge of
a home of convalescent officers?

224
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,324
Only one such home
has been opened

225
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,867
in Northumberland
in the last month

226
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,204
and that's Musgrave Manor
at Hurlstone.

227
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,622
Simple reasoning,

228
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,290
a child could do it.

229
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,834
- Not your child, Watson.
- No, of course--

230
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,836
What?
I never had a child.

231
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,463
I very nearly did though.

232
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,549
Did I ever tell you about
that widow at Twickenham?

233
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,092
A very narrow escape.

234
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,011
I just found out in time

235
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,471
that she had the most horrible little
squirt about three and a half.

236
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,598
Yes, Watson. I think we better
stick to Hurlstone.

237
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,850
Oh, sorry, old boy?
Oh Hurlstone.

238
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,311
It's a grim old pile,
very spooky.

239
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,104
Don't tell me that
you met a ghost.

240
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,357
Well, not so spooky as that.

241
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,610
Ghosts don't stab people
in the neck do they?

242
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,488
Or do they?

243
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,199
Not well-bred ghosts, Watson.

244
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,659
Who was stabbed in the neck?

245
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,453
My young assistant, Dr. Sexton.

246
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,205
- When?
- Last night.

247
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,540
Any idea who did it?

248
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,749
I have no idea.

249
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,168
- You reported it?
- Well, no, no I didn't.

250
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,253
Why not?

251
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,546
Well you see is it--

252
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,422
My dear fellow,
what you're trying to say is

253
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,716
the officers in your care
are all fine fellows,

254
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,718
wonderful war records
and so on. Is that it?

255
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,345
Precisely.

256
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,515
- So you thought perhaps
a private investigation.
- Exactly.

257
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,433
Very right and proper thinking,
Watson.

258
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,811
We're just in time to
catch the nine thirty train
for Hurlstone.

259
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,398
- But my dear fellow,
there's no immediate hurry.
- Isn't there?

260
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,900
Your patients are all
victims of combat fatigue.

261
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,444
Any one of them might go
over the edge at any moment

262
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,238
and from what you've told me

263
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,323
there's a killer loose
at Hurlstone.

264
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,033
Great Scott,
you may be right.

265
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,412
Come along, Watson.
We haven't a moment to lose.

266
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,080
I only hope we shan't
be too late.

267
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,385
You were right, Watson,
about Musgrave Manor.

268
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,512
Houses like people
have definite personalities

269
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,056
and this place is
positively ghoulish.

270
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,683
It certainly is.

271
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,060
Hello.

272
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,645
What's that?

273
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,481
- Just the old greenhouse.
- No, no, that pile of leaves.

274
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,901
Just an ordinary
pile of leaves. Why?

275
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,777
Doesn't it strike you
as odd, Watson,

276
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,195
that a pile of leaves
should be raked up

277
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,198
in front of a
greenhouse door?

278
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,618
No gardener in the world
would do that.

279
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,380
Geoffrey Musgrave.

280
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,530
That's all very interesting,
Inspector Lestrade,

281
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,492
but what, may I ask,
does it prove?

282
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,869
What I'm trying to prove
is this,

283
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,997
- that Dr. Sexton here
went down...
- That's twice now, inspector.

284
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,707
- He was stunned.
- Naturally.

285
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,917
He went out longer
than you thought.

286
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,502
- That's the point.
- What point?

287
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,128
Just this.

288
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,546
The man who attacked him had
time to get back in the house

289
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,091
- before Dr. Sexton here
came to.
- Yes?

290
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,133
Yes.

291
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,260
And this here glove--

292
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,972
Oh, and this here glove

293
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,432
what I picked up at
the scene of the crime,

294
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,477
belongs to a certain party
right here in this house.

295
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,979
I say.

296
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,231
- Well that glove
belongs to my brother.
- Huh?

297
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,733
Do you suggest that he
intended to murder Dr. Sexton?

298
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,652
Who knows?

299
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,696
The man whose hand
fits this here glove

300
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,239
will bear a talking to.

301
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,449
Very well. My brother's
down at the stables.

302
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,284
- I'll take you to him myself.
- Thank you.

303
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,704
It's the quickest way
to put a stop to this
blithering nonsense.

304
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,997
Come on.

305
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,540
- Oh, Mr. Phillip,
- Yes.

306
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,917
better not go out in
the night air without a coat.

307
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,003
- Here, take mine.
- Thanks.

308
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,674
Well, I won't need this.

309
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,802
No, oh, nor this.

310
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,637
Well, shall we go?

311
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,182
Why if it ain't Mr. Holmes?

312
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,517
Good evening, Lestrade.

313
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,810
Come to give us a hand,
have you?

314
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,270
Always happy to help,
inspector.

315
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,147
Thanks but I don't think
I shall be needing any.

316
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,193
Why if it isn't Dr. Watson.

317
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,071
Gentlemen, this is my friend,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

318
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,032
Mr. Phillip Musgrave
and Dr. Sexton.

319
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,491
- How do you do?
- How do you do.

320
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,994
I'll just put him up to
spend a few days with us.

321
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,495
That's very good of you

322
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,706
but as you see Scotland Yard's
already taken charge.

323
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,666
Oh really?
That's most unfortunate.

324
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,460
If you don't mind,
Dr. Watson,

325
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,795
I'd like to have a little talk
with your brother, sir.

326
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,090
- I'm afraid you can't have
that pleasure, inspector.
- Oh no?

327
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,259
I've got bad news for you,
Mr. Musgrave.

328
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,928
We've just found your brother
in the lime walk.

329
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,930
He's dead.

330
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,808
You can't mean it.

331
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,351
No.

332
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,023
Look here, Holmes, if this is
one of your little jokes.

333
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,776
Murder's no joke,
inspector.

334
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,987
That's right, Mr. Holmes.
Nobody's saying it ain't.

335
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,614
Murder?
Well let's get going.

336
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,491
- I'll take charge now.
- What?

337
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,326
But it's quite within my rights
as a local justice of the peace.

338
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,952
I'll come with you.

339
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,683
Wait a minute, you fool.

340
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,602
Don't go barging in like that.

341
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,479
Don't maul me.

342
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,567
Surgical instruments.

343
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,028
You know Watson,
the instruments that save life

344
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,364
are hardly more pleasant to look
at than those that take it.

345
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
Hmm.

346
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,866
Grisly thought, Holmes.

347
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,955
You rang, Dr. Watson?

348
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,581
Yes, Brunton.

349
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,166
I want you to take some men
and go down to the lime walk.

350
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,670
Me, sir, well I can't sir.
I'm sorry but I simply can't.

351
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,797
My stomach, you know.

352
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,884
I really couldn't
look at a corpse.

353
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,928
- Corpse?
- Well I--

354
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,013
How did you know
that there was a corpse?

355
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,015
Obviously, he was listening
at the door.

356
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,184
I'll take care of
the matter, doctor.

357
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,228
I was listening too.

358
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,147
Come along, Brunton.

359
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,362
Remarkable woman.

360
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,447
Housekeeper, I suppose.

361
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,116
She's very efficient.

362
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,743
Same type as Marianne Carpenter,
the trunk murderess.

363
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,581
Extraordinary house.

364
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,791
Yes, it's is indeed.

365
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,376
Now Watson,
if you don't mind

366
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,004
I'd like to have a word with
your extraordinary patients.

367
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,130
Let me remind you, Holmes,

368
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,466
that my patients are
just patients.

369
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,634
Quite so.

370
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,846
All normal men,
sound in mind and body

371
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,182
- and no sign of
psychoneurosis.
- I quite understand.

372
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,186
Then Holmes even normal people
are sometimes a little--

373
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,355
Precisely.

374
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,283
Hello, Mack.

375
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,621
Oh, I must have taken
a wee nap.

376
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,539
Mack, I want you to meet
a very old friend of mine,

377
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,208
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Captain Mackintosh.

378
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,292
How do you do?

379
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,919
I have heard of you,
Mr. Holmes.

380
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,129
- Sorry to have wakened you.
- Oh, that's quite all right.

381
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,547
- See you later.
- Yes.

382
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,507
Sit down Mack and
go on with your sleep.

383
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,725
Poor chap. He lay wounded
in a trench on Josher Hill.

384
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,560
The German tanks
went over him.

385
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,481
- Watson?
- Huh?

386
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,608
Have you any idea how
Jeffery Musgrave met his death?

387
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,777
Yes,
a depressed skull fracture.

388
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,862
Wait, hang on a minute Holmes,
it isn't.

389
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,697
Isn't it?
Why not?

390
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,951
- No edema, no bleeding,
no contraction of tissue.
- Precisely.

391
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,953
The blow on the head
was delivered after death.

392
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,621
Musgrave was killed
by a sharp instrument

393
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,998
thrusted between the base of
the skull and the top vertebra.

394
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,000
Great Scott.

395
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,710
Should we go up now?

396
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,843
- Hello, Langford.
- Oh, hello there.

397
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,554
Been away, haven't you,
haven't you?

398
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,266
Yes, I just been down to London.
I brought my friend back.

399
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,142
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Major Langford.

400
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,520
Well, see you at dinner.
What...what?

401
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,854
I hope so.

402
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,525
I hope so. I hope so.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

403
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,529
Poor chap was at Singapore,

404
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,531
escaped from a Japanese
prison camp,

405
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,032
ghastly experience.

406
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,909
- He's suffering from--
- Escape complex obviously.

407
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,037
Yes. He's a very nice
chap, though.

408
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,455
The next fellow
I want you to meet

409
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,458
is young Clavering,
Lieutenant Royal Engineers.

410
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,545
Saw a lot of men blown to bits
by Nazi booby traps.

411
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,797
- He's a bit on edge.
- Not unnaturally.

412
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,637
Coming.

413
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,685
Well, Dr. Watson.
Come in, won't you?

414
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,687
Sorry to keep you so long.

415
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,522
You see I, uh,

416
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,025
I was lying down, resting.

417
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,694
This is my friend, Mr. Holmes,
who's here for a few days.

418
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,862
Mr. Clavering.

419
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,988
- Glad to meet you.
- How do you do?

420
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,157
- Sorry to disturb you.
- Not at all.

421
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,533
I say, you don't happen to have

422
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,327
some cigarettes about you,
do you?

423
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,495
That's one of the reasons I came.
I brought you some of those

424
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,123
American cigarettes
that you're so fond of.

425
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,500
It's all right, open it up.

426
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,295
No hurry, no hurry at all.

427
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,839
No, no, no.
Of course there isn't.

428
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,257
Shall we go?

429
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,134
Yes, well we must be off.
We've got a lot to do.

430
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,303
- See you later.
- Yes, I'll be back.

431
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,679
Good night.

432
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,476
He seems afraid there might
be a bomb in that package.

433
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,353
Well he'd find them in
less likely places than that

434
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,146
the poor chap.

435
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,231
The man in this room is
an American Flying officer.

436
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,192
Captain Vickery, nothing
really much matter with him.

437
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,777
What's he here for then?

438
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,987
On a rest, had a pretty
long go and he's worn out.

439
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,238
He needs all the rest
he can get.

440
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,993
Vickery,
Vickery.

441
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,787
He doesn't seem to be in.

442
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,334
No one at home.

443
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,919
Hmm.

444
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,754
Apparently not.

445
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,800
Not since teatime at any rate.

446
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,886
Hello, what's this?

447
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,846
"Captain Vickery,
here's your tea.

448
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,556
If it's cold don't blame me."

449
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,684
That sounds like
Brunton's work.

450
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,228
The butler?

451
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,480
He fancies himself a poet
but only when he's drinking.

452
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,815
I see.

453
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,691
Wasn't there an American killer
given to verse?

454
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,737
- Holmes, you don't think
that Brunton --
- Excuse me.

455
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,323
I merely stated

456
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,450
there's an American killer
given to verse.

457
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,828
Dr. Watson,
oh where are you?

458
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,371
Oh, there you are.

459
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,164
Steady my dear, steady.

460
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,999
Please make me wake up,
won't you?

461
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,085
It's just a bad dream,
I know,

462
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,711
- Geoff and Pat--
- Now, now, now, my dear.

463
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,505
You got to get a grip
on yourself.

464
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,299
Come on, come on,
come sit down.

465
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,928
My brother, Geoff, murdered.

466
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,180
Poor old Geoff.

467
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,975
And I hadn't spoken to him
since we had the fight
yesterday on Pat,

468
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,895
I mean, Captain Vickery's
account and now he's dead.

469
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,857
Now, now my dear you must
pull yourself together.

470
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,733
But you don't understand.

471
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,528
They're trying to say
that Pat--

472
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,447
they're trying to prove
that Pat killed Geoff.

473
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,241
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

474
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,076
Funny isn't it.

475
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,953
Awfully funny.

476
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,540
- Awfully funny, awfully funny!
- Stop it!

477
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,750
- Who are you?
- My name is Holmes.

478
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,003
- Sherlock Holmes?
- Yes.

479
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,464
Then you'll help us, won't you
Mr. Holmes, Pat and me.

480
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,840
I'll try to.

481
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,675
Now tell me,
wasn't there bad blood

482
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,260
between your brother,
Geoffrey and Captain Vickery?

483
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,428
That's got nothing
to do with it.

484
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,846
It may have everything
to do with it.

485
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,347
If you think Captain Vickery
ever murdered anyone

486
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,224
you're no more of a
detective than,

487
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,060
- than Dr. Watson.
- Oh, my dear.

488
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,062
Oh, I'm sorry.

489
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,192
You're very much in love,
aren't you?

490
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,402
I'm out of my mind,
Mr. Holmes.

491
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,905
I'm out of my mind.

492
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,657
Oh, please forgive me
and please, please help me.

493
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,242
Of course, of course
I understand.

494
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,744
But you don't understand,

495
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,287
that appalling man from
Scotland Yard

496
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,789
is questioning Pat
at this very moment.

497
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,209
Now this here rake,

498
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,085
it's the identical one you got
from the garden this afternoon,

499
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,670
now ain't it?

500
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,549
It smells like it.

501
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,259
Hey what is this? Are you trying
to prove that Geoffrey Musgrave

502
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,302
was killed with a rake?

503
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,095
No, I'm try--

504
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,306
never mind
what I'm trying to prove.

505
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,849
Just incriminate yourself,
Captain Vickery.

506
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,226
That's all Lestrade wants.

507
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,019
I'll thank you to
keep out of this, Mr. Holmes.

508
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,145
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

509
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,271
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

510
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,356
He's promised to help you, dear.

511
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,649
There's nothing to
worry about now.

512
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,984
Only his neck, miss.
Let me see your rake.

513
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,528
What do you say
you were using it for?

514
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,072
I told you. I got it to fish
my cap out of the pond.

515
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,532
It blew in.

516
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,784
Oh, so you were using it
down at the pond, were you?

517
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,619
For the tenth time, yes.

518
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,412
And how did it happen
to turn up alongside
Musgrave's body, eh?

519
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,165
- I don't know.
- Uh-huh, Well that's that.

520
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,792
Oh, Mr. Holmes.

521
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,752
Any fingerprints
on the rake, inspector?

522
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,587
No, Mr. Holmes.
That's the point.

523
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,131
If Vickery here was only using
it to fish his hat out

524
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,634
well now he wouldn't bother
to wipe his fingerprints off
now would he?

525
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,927
It's beyond imagination,
I suppose,

526
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,095
that somebody else
could have used the rake

527
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,055
and wiped off both sets
of fingerprints.

528
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,474
Highly interesting
but very unlikely.

529
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,560
Now you admit
that you had a regular set to

530
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,353
with Jeffrey Musgrave
yesterday, didn't you?

531
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,771
You threatened to
bash his head in.

532
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,606
I merely made the offer.
He didn't accept it.

533
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,774
- Who told you so?
- He did.

534
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Oh, no, he did.

535
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,027
I only stated what I heard.

536
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,196
Captain Vickery did
threaten my brother.

537
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,199
That's right, Mr. Holmes and
it's no good saying it ain't.

538
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,618
This Yankee lad had
motive and opportunity

539
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,830
and the rake ties him
right up tight to the corpse.

540
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,457
All right.
Come along.

541
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,213
Do you really think he
killed old Musgrave?

542
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,007
You know very well he didn't.

543
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,883
Stop clicking those needles.

544
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,969
- Oh, Pat.
- Take it easy, Sally.

545
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,554
Now look, don't worry a bit.

546
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,181
I'll tell you everything's
gonna be all right.

547
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,933
Let's go, inspector.

548
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,732
Mr. Holmes.

549
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,483
Steady.
Steady.

550
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,694
- Aren't you on our side?
- Yes, Sally.

551
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,112
Then why don't you
do something.

552
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,655
Because Captain Vickery
will be much safer

553
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,073
in the local police station
tonight

554
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,283
than he would be in this house.

555
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,410
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
what am I going to do?

556
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,786
Watson, get your sedative.

557
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,746
I'll get it at once.

558
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,539
Come along, Sally.

559
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,428
She's a bit upset
but she'll get over it.

560
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,221
You think so?

561
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,348
She'll have to.

562
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,849
She's got an ordeal
ahead of her.

563
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,852
She has to go through
that tiresome ritual tomorrow.

564
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,063
Ritual?

565
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,732
This is an old family ceremony,
Mr. Holmes.

566
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:36,236
Sally's next in line now that
I'm head of the household.

567
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,239
Blast this thing.

568
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,949
Does this help?

569
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,118
Oh yes, thanks.

570
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,953
Knitting needle, isn't it?

571
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,330
Yes.

572
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,083
Handy little things.

573
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,752
As my heir. Sally has to
recite a sort of formula

574
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,921
over Geoff's body
in front of the fireplace

575
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,216
and the library in the presence
of the entire household.

576
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,385
There, that's better.

577
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,887
Just what sort of formula?

578
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,097
Oh, it's some
meaningless words,

579
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,057
Musgrave ritual, they call it.

580
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,644
It's an old family custom been
handed down for generations.

581
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,814
- Can you remember the words?
- No, no, not at all.

582
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,609
But you had to speak them when
you're brother Geoffrey took over.

583
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,946
Yes, that's right, I did.

584
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
Let me see now.

585
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,368
"Who first shall find it
were better dead

586
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,746
Who next shall find it
perils his head.

587
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,333
The last to find it
defies dark powers."

588
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:37,005
"Who first shall find it
were better dead.

589
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,843
Who next shall find it
perils his head.

590
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,555
The last to find it
defies dark powers

591
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:48,100
and brings good fortune
to Hurlstone Towers.

592
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,187
Where was the light
on the face of the messenger?

593
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,897
Where did he speed?

594
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,816
To guard the queen's page.

595
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:07,119
Walked home in advanced
the bishop's page brashly

596
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,749
and who to repel,
the king's cautious page.

597
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,168
What then the--

598
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,091
disaster

599
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:26,722
queen slaughter's page."

600
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,516
No, no.
Sorry, Miss Sally.

601
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,936
"Page slaughters Page."

602
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,563
Thank you, Brunton.

603
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,821
"Who came then to slay him?

604
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,157
The bloodthirsty bishop.

605
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,201
Where shall he go?

606
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,286
Deep down below.

607
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,376
Away from the thunder,

608
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,171
let him dig under."

609
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,563
Once more into the breach,
dear friends,

610
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,232
once more.

611
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,362
Happy day.

612
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,450
You drunken sot.

613
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,619
The master's been ringing you
for the past ten minutes.

614
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,037
Why don't you answer it?

615
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,706
Fly away, little gremlin.

616
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,916
You're the one that'll fly away

617
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,417
if he ever catches you
in this state.

618
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,213
My sir, it's him.
Hurry, hurry.

619
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,924
Coming, sir.
Coming.

620
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,054
One moment, sir.

621
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:01,525
Mr. Holmes,
come in, sir, come in.

622
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,240
This is indeed an honor.

623
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,954
I don't often have visitors.

624
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,914
What can I do for you, sir?

625
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,208
You might stop that
squeaking to begin with.

626
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,626
Yes, sir.

627
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,669
And perhaps you can tell me
how you come to know

628
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,087
the Musgrave ritual
by heart.

629
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,381
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

630
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,174
When Miss Sally forgot
the lines today

631
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,802
you were the one
who prompted her.

632
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,762
Well, sir I memorized it.

633
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,473
Obviously but why?

634
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,435
Because it has no meaning.

635
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,147
I love things
that have no meaning.

636
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,066
Thank you, Brunton.

637
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,860
But supposing it did
have a meaning

638
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,069
and suppose that meaning
were tied up

639
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,946
with a murder of
Geoffrey Musgrave.

640
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:52,200
Oh, what a lovely idea
if I may say so.

641
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,702
You may, Brunton.

642
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,537
You may also sit down.

643
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,164
Thank you, sir.

644
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,297
Oh stop it,

645
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,840
and look at me.

646
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,092
No, here.

647
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,261
You know the meaning
of the Musgrave ritual.

648
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,971
- Do I?
- Well, don't you?

649
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,934
You'd be surprised
at all the things I know.

650
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,518
What things?

651
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,854
- No you don't.
- About the Musgraves?

652
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,522
That would be telling.

653
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,566
But here's to them anyway

654
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,320
all the Musgraves
past and present,

655
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,324
some of 'em were murderers
and some of 'em worse

656
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,035
but they all knew
how to keep a secret

657
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,204
and so do I.

658
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,164
Brunton.

659
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,004
I've been ringing for you
for the past ten minutes.

660
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,383
Sorry, sir but the buzzer
doesn't buzz.

661
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,719
That'll do, Brunton.

662
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,180
You have your notice.
Do you understand?

663
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,306
Yes, sir.

664
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,641
Is that advisable,
Mr. Musgrave?

665
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,518
Let me be the judge of that.

666
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,979
- He leaves Hurlstone
in the morning.
- The morning's a long way off.

667
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,691
Farewell,

668
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:10,070
a long farewell
to all my greatness.

669
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,531
You've done it now,
Al Brunton.

670
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,700
After all we've been through.

671
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,369
How could I of managed
to do it all alone?

672
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,205
What are you going to do?

673
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,958
What am I going to do?

674
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:08,628
Thirteen again.

675
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,756
Yes.

676
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,360
Howells whole attitude
confuses me, Watson.

677
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,571
She swears that she hasn't
set eyes on Brunton since night

678
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,823
and yet she seems completely
unwilling to help us find him.

679
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,034
Quite so, she knows where
he is as well as we do,

680
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,203
- I mean as well as we don't.
- I wonder.

681
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,330
You said that he was
drinking last night.

682
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,624
Wouldn't it be a good idea
to try the pub?

683
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,042
Exactly where we're
headed for, Watson.

684
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,460
I'm glad we thought of it

685
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,670
even if we don't find Brunton.

686
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,842
I was afraid we
couldn't find him here.

687
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,261
Don't worry, old boy.
I could do with a drink.

688
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,181
For your information
so could I.

689
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,849
- Gentlemen.
- Well hello, doctor.

690
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,559
Not looking for us are you,
are you?

691
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,437
Well no. As a matter of fact
we're looking for--

692
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,522
Brunton.

693
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,731
You haven't seen him,
have you?

694
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,650
Have we Clavering,
have we?

695
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,069
Why should we?

696
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,695
- Morning, Gracie.
- Morning, doctor.

697
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,780
What do you have?

698
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,281
A bottle of Bass
and what's yours?

699
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,283
- A pint of bitter, please.
- And a pint of bitter.

700
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,203
I'm a devil. I'm a devil.

701
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,455
Oh really?

702
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,999
Hello.
A tame raven.

703
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,460
You're a devil are you,
a kettle are you?

704
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,671
I'm a devil.
I'm a devil.

705
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,506
Birds of prey, aren't they?

706
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,675
Yes, in a way,
scavengers rather.

707
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,301
They can smell a carcass
a half a mile off.

708
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,053
Yeah, that they can and all.

709
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,388
You should see Charlie here

710
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,307
when there's a tasty bit
outside in the street.

711
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,059
Shall we go sit down?

712
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,248
Gracie, have you seen
Dr. Watson?

713
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,709
- He's over there, lass.
- Thank you.

714
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,629
May I speak to you a moment,
Mr. Holmes?

715
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,548
- What's wrong, Sally?
- We can't find my brother
Phillip.

716
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,924
Did you look in his room?

717
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,176
That's the trouble,
we had to force the door.

718
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,094
- It was locked on the inside.
- Really?

719
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,972
- Yes. Oh, you must come,
Mr. Holmes.
- Certainly, Sally, at once.

720
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,855
Do be quick something ghastly
has happened. I know it.

721
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,940
And that dreadful bird,
please swat it away.

722
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,735
Watson, take her away.

723
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,028
Away, where to?

724
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,071
Anywhere. Into the pub.
Just take her away.

725
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,958
Phillip Musgrave.

726
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,675
What are they doing now,
doing now?

727
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,346
I don't know.
They stopped talking.

728
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,349
Somebody's walking about
in the upper hall,

729
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,892
heavy footsteps.

730
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,610
There's no doubt about it,
Watson.

731
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,404
Phillip Musgrave had a visitor
here last night.

732
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,448
These footprints were made
either by a very heavy man

733
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,158
or a man carrying
a very heavy burden.

734
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,744
That's right, Mr. Holmes.
It's no good saying it ain't.

735
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,871
The burden was
Phillip Musgrave's body

736
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,832
and these here footprints
were made by Alfred Brunton.

737
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,378
- It doesn't necessarily
follow.
- Oh, don't it.

738
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,425
Here,
try that on your footprint.

739
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,099
And that's
Alfred Brunton's shoe.

740
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,059
- Fits perfectly, inspector.
- Uh-huh.

741
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,811
But the fact that these prints
were made by Brunton's shoes

742
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,479
doesn't prove that Brunton's
feet were in them.

743
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,023
Why not? Where should Brunton's
feet be if not in his own shoe?

744
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,067
Well they're not in them now,
are they?

745
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,528
- Look here, Holmes.
Let's use our intellect.
- Your what?

746
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,862
What's wrong with that.

747
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,447
Let's stick to motive.
That's my strong point.

748
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,533
Now this here Brunton
had motive.

749
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,660
Phillip Musgrave gave
him the sack, didn't he?

750
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,578
Did Geoffrey Musgrave
also gave him the sack?

751
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,289
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything.

752
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,332
The similarity of method
in both murders

753
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,583
shows they were the work
of one man.

754
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,585
Well that leaves Vickery out.

755
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,920
- He was in jail at the time
of this murder.
- All right, Watson. All right.

756
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,798
Alfred Brunton's our man,
just what I said.

757
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,633
What possible motive
could Brunton have had

758
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,093
for the murder of
Geoffrey Musgrave?

759
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,178
Motive. Oh, bother motive.
Who cares about motive.

760
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,848
- This case is as
simple as A, B, C.
- Is it?

761
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,141
Then perhaps you can
explain to us

762
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,101
why these footprints
lead up to a blank wall

763
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,394
and never return.

764
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,854
What?

765
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,522
You didn't think of that,
did you inspector?

766
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,276
- There's just one
possible explanation.
- I've got it.

767
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,738
Brunton murdered Musgrave
right up against the wall.

768
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,033
He hoisted the body over
his shoulder like this you see,

769
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,826
walks backwards
clean out of the room--

770
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,040
That's a very undignified
position, Lestrade.

771
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,666
Upsy daisy.

772
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,586
In a house as old as this

773
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,629
it's not unusual to
find secret passageways

774
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,340
that lead down
through the walls.

775
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,383
Hello, here we are.

776
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,345
No you don't,
Come out of there.

777
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,770
What are you doing in there?

778
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,355
- None of your business.
- Answer me.

779
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,814
Obviously, she was
looking for Brunton.

780
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,399
That's right.

781
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,026
He hasn't left Musgrave Manor.
I'm certain of that, sir.

782
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,819
His clothes are still hanging
in the wardrobe.

783
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,363
Don't you lie to me, woman.

784
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,781
You've got him hidden
in there somewhere.

785
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,740
Don't go in there?

786
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,491
Why not?

787
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,408
You'll get lost.

788
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,286
Me lost?
Oh, I like that.

789
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,205
- He will get lost, sir.
- Let him.

790
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,873
Now listen to me.

791
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,875
Where did you enter
that passageway?

792
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,127
- Through the old greenhouse
in lime walk, sir.
- Did Brunton know that?

793
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,505
- No, he didn't.
- Mrs. Brunton,

794
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,215
then why were you
looking for him in there?

795
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,841
We...I--

796
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,677
Yes, we've known all along that
you were married to Brunton.

797
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,055
- You know Phillip Musgrave
was murdered, don't you?
- No.

798
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,099
- Yes, you do and you think
Brunton did it.
- No.

799
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,101
- You think he carried him down
through the greenhouse--
- No, no.

800
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,769
- Over to the garage--
- No, he never.

801
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,396
And crammed his body into the
rumble seat of that roadster.

802
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,855
Don't you try and
put the blame on Alfr--

803
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,607
I'll put the blame on
both of you.

804
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,025
You're in this together.

805
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,735
You were in his room last
night, I saw you there.

806
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,946
Only to talk about
the ritual, sir.

807
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,656
He...we,

808
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,033
he thought that he'd
got it all worked out.

809
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,120
- Did he leave any notes,
any record?
- No, that is--

810
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,415
Oh come on, come on,
out with it.

811
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,083
Only this, sir.

812
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,710
I found it this morning under
the soap dish on his washstand.

813
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,920
Hmm.
Hastily written.

814
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,672
- Another jingle?
- Yes.

815
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,134
Obviously in some agitation.

816
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,011
"If any harm should come to me
fleshly or spiritual

817
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,722
seek and you will find the key
in the Musgrave ritual."

818
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,808
The old ritual,
there it is again.

819
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,268
Watson, we've got to find
that ritual. It's the key to
the whole business.

820
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,353
- Just a minute,
you can't talk to Sally.
- Why not?

821
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,022
- She's in such a state
and I had to give a hypo.
- All right, come along.

822
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,987
Draw the curtains, Watson.

823
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,868
There must be a copy of that
ritual somewhere in this room.

824
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,035
She had to learn it,
you know.

825
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,537
Yes, you're right.

826
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,746
Here it is.

827
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,915
I doubt it.

828
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,292
- Empty.
- Quite.

829
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,043
There's only one thing to do,
search the room.

830
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,296
Not the room, Watson.
Her mind.

831
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,631
We must search her mind.

832
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,134
Obviously, she took
great pains to hide that paper.

833
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,094
But why should she hide it?

834
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,762
Put yourself in her place.

835
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,473
Her brother Geoffrey
was murdered.

836
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,057
The man she loves
is accused of that murder

837
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,976
and thrown into jail.
On top of that

838
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,936
she finds her brother,
Phillip, murdered.

839
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,688
What would your reactions be?

840
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,690
- Well, naturally
I should be terribly upset.
- Obviously.

841
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,900
Excuse me.

842
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,361
She's brought back
to this house in a state
bordering on hysteria.

843
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,864
She comes through that door,
goes to that desk,

844
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,449
throws on her gloves.

845
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,410
The first thing her eye lights
on is the Musgrave ritual.

846
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,537
In her mind it's tied up
with all the disasters

847
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,872
that have befallen Hurlstone.

848
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,832
She herself
may be the next victim.

849
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,292
She must hide that paper.

850
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,169
You're quite right,
but where?

851
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,507
Excuse me, sir.

852
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,176
Was she alone in this room
at any time

853
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,427
before you gave her the hypo?

854
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,429
Certainly not.
Nora was here.

855
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,933
- She helped her into bed
while I went for my bag.
- Good.

856
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,309
- Nora?
- Yes, sir.

857
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,393
When you were alone
with Miss Sally

858
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,686
what was the first thing
she did?

859
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,980
Well sir, she asked me
to turn down her bed

860
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,566
- and lay out her nightdress.
- And what was she doing
in the meantime?

861
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,527
Let me think, sir.

862
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,612
Oh yes,
she went over to her desk.

863
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,864
Uh-huh. That was when she took
the ritual from this envelope.

864
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,366
What then Nora?

865
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,701
Then she asked me to step over
and draw the curtains.

866
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,703
Why someone's
pulled them open.

867
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,455
Yes, I know.
When you drew the curtains
you turned your back on her?

868
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,041
Sure. And it wasn't more than
two shakes of a lamb's tail.

869
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,085
Long enough.

870
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,711
When you were at the window
where was she?

871
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,089
She was sitting over here,

872
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,717
sitting right here
taking off her stockings.

873
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,053
Oh, but she never left the
chair. I'll kiss the book on it.

874
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,805
I've got it.

875
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,724
She must have packed that paper
under this cushion.

876
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,393
Oh.

877
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,644
She must have changed
her mind.

878
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,979
Obviously.

879
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,190
Well she could have
hidden it anywhere here.

880
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,322
What time was it when you
brought her in here, Watson?

881
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,074
I haven't the faintest idea.

882
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,118
The clock was striking the
quarter hour when I came in, sir.

883
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,828
- I definitely heard it.
- This clock?

884
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,789
- The same, sir.
- Thank you, Nora,
you may go.

885
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,166
Obviously this clock
was running at twelve fifteen,

886
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,712
- just as obviously it
stopped at twelve twenty.
- Huh?

887
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,715
When Nora turned her back
Sally reached across,

888
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,883
opened the clock

889
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,136
and hid the ritual in here.

890
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,722
- Amazing, Holmes.
- Elementary my dear, Watson.

891
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,812
"Where fell the light on
the face of the messenger."

892
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:34,444
"Where did he speed?
To guard the queen's Page."

893
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,195
Gibberish, that's what it is.

894
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,989
Hokey pokey, penny a lump.

895
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,616
A thing like this, Watson, that's
been handed down for centuries

896
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,827
can't be mere gibberish.

897
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,789
"Who had entered the lists?
The king's pale knight."

898
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:47,874
Pale poppycock.

899
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,584
I say, Watson.

900
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,252
King, queen, knight, bishop.

901
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,172
- Sounds like a game
of chess to me.
- Precisely.

902
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,050
"Where fell the light."

903
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,011
The light, Watson.

904
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,765
"Follow the light

905
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,725
on the face of a messenger."

906
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,101
Look at it, Watson.

907
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,146
Look at it,
like a giant chessboard.

908
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,023
This is no gibberish.

909
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,400
These are chess terms
and that's the chessboard.

910
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,195
The secret of the Musgrave murders
is locked up in that floor

911
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,656
and by Jove,
we've got the key to it.

912
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:27,705
"Who had entered the lists.
The king's pale knight."

913
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,292
White king's knight to
white king's bishop three.

914
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,752
Your move, Dr. Sexton.

915
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,253
I really know nothing
about the game.

916
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,963
Come on, Bob.
It's great fun.

917
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,340
You start from over here.

918
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,300
Over here.
I'll show you.

919
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,010
I'll show you.

920
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,723
One,

921
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,766
two,

922
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,934
three,

923
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,268
one.

924
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,649
Page to the black king three.

925
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,235
Your move Clavering to back
king three, please. Over there.

926
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,362
There's not to reason why.

927
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,789
"Page slaughters page."

928
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,377
Your move, Watson.

929
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,837
I take you, my dear.

930
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,130
It's a good game, isn't it?

931
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,430
Stop it, stop it.
You mustn't giggle.

932
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,473
You must be serious.

933
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,105
You're move, Clavering.
You take Dr. Watson.

934
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,149
Too bad, doctor.

935
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:45,533
"Who came then to slay him,
the bloodthirsty bishop."

936
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,328
White queen's bishop,
to white king's knight five.

937
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,080
That's my move.

938
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,591
One, two--

939
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,760
I say, doctor,
you moved, didn't you?

940
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,094
Did I?
I don't think so.

941
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,763
Yes, I'm afraid you did.

942
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,391
- Oh, where was I on
king bishop three?
- That's right.

943
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,227
Oh yes, of course.
So sorry.

944
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,440
Three, four, five.

945
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,358
Captain it looks bad for you.

946
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:23,362
Aye, but
where shall I go?

947
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,867
"Where shall he go?
Deep down below."

948
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,119
Mrs. Howells,
what's underneath this floor?

949
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,581
Well, it's only an old cellar, sir.

950
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,667
The entrance goes
down behind that stair

951
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,670
but it's been locked up
for centuries.

952
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,130
One of the old Musgraves

953
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,174
murdered his own brother
down there.

954
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,426
Shh, listen.

955
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,930
Hello, what's that?

956
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,682
It's Brunton.

957
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,601
Alf, Alf?

958
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,395
He's in that passageway
over the fireplace.

959
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,939
Are you there, Brunton?

960
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,232
Get me out!

961
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,692
It's me, Lestrade.

962
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,402
I'm lost.

963
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,613
I'm all turned around.

964
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,240
You have been for years.

965
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,199
Get him out there,
will you, Mrs. Howells

966
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,867
and give him a saucer of milk.

967
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,328
Come here, Jenny.
Stand on this square for me

968
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,580
and stamp on it,
keep stamping.

969
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,832
Clavering, get your
sound detector.

970
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,125
Gentlemen,
deep down below.

971
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,482
Look, there's not been a
soul here in a couple of
hundred years.

972
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,150
Someone's been here

973
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,819
and in the last
twenty-four hours.

974
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,322
- Yeah, it's clean as a new pin.
- Precisely.

975
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,408
Dust of two hundred years
is on the walls.

976
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,951
The floor's been swept clean

977
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,370
obviously in an attempt
to remove footprints.

978
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:58,624
Shh, listen.

979
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,835
That's Jenny
in the hall upstairs.

980
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:08,050
Clavering,

981
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,011
let me have your
sound detector.

982
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,434
So sorry.

983
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,068
I must find the exact spot under
that square I marked in the hall.

984
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,869
Don't move, anyone.

985
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,797
Someone's moving about

986
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,050
interfering with
what I'm trying to do.

987
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,513
Stand perfectly still
everybody.

988
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,496
This is the spot.
Lend me a hand.

989
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,830
Of course.

990
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,167
- Here, I'll take that.
- Oh, thanks, old fellow.

991
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,673
- Hello.
- Good gracious me.

992
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:34,053
"Here lies the body of
Ralph Musgrave, knight,

993
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,972
the lord of the
manors of Hurlstone."

994
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,100
This place used to be
known as Hurlstone Towers.

995
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:44,563
"Neverfield and King's Hargrave
Anno Domini 1539."

996
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,440
What we're looking for
is underneath here

997
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,568
that's what the ritual
meant by deep down low.
It's a burial crypt.

998
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,195
Up with it.

999
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,790
I say, there's somebody
down there.

1000
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,250
Who is it?
Is it Brunton?

1001
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,376
Is it Brunton?

1002
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,004
I don't know.
Stay where you are.

1003
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,896
Who is it, Holmes?

1004
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,356
It's Brunton all right.

1005
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,899
Is he dead?

1006
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,526
Yes.

1007
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,570
He's been dead for hours.

1008
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,364
Murdered.

1009
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,492
Hello, what's this?

1010
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,340
"Henry by the grace of god,
King of Great Britain,

1011
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,887
France and Ireland,
defender of the faith..."

1012
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,223
- What have you found?
- Any clue, any clue?

1013
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,644
Uh, no, um...

1014
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,649
Just an old document.

1015
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,404
Hello.
What's this?

1016
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,285
Looks like some sort
of writing. Watson.

1017
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,995
Coming.

1018
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,707
Hold this for me, will you?
Steady.

1019
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,335
They're on the floor
by his right hand.

1020
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,003
See those marks in the dust

1021
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,756
like pin scratches made
with his fingernail?

1022
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,344
Yes. Yes.

1023
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,721
See that stuff under his nail?

1024
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,098
He was trying to
write something.

1025
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,641
By Jove!

1026
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,934
He did write something.

1027
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,185
What is it?

1028
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,978
Aye, tell us man.

1029
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,605
What did he write?

1030
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:54,068
I can't make it out.
It's too faint.

1031
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,446
Here. I've got good eyes,
let me, let me.

1032
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,657
Stay where you are,
all of you.

1033
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:08,290
These marks
must not be erased.

1034
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,251
What are you going to do,
Holmes?

1035
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,419
I'm going to leave
this just as it is

1036
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:16,006
until I can get the proper
chemicals to bring out the words.

1037
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,552
Have you no notion of
what he tried to write?

1038
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,345
Yes, I have.

1039
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:25,099
I think that Brunton
with his last strength

1040
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,476
wrote the name of his murderer
on that floor

1041
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,395
in his own blood.

1042
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,917
Oh, there you are, Lestrade.

1043
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,794
Huh.
Twelve o'clock.

1044
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,504
I was just saying, Lestrade,

1045
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,423
that I should get into
New Castle,

1046
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,508
pick up my chemicals
and be back here not later than
noon tomorrow.

1047
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,177
- Why yes, Mr. Holmes.
- Meanwhile, you all have
your work cut out for you.

1048
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,928
- Watson.
- Yes?

1049
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,141
You'll guard this door
with your life.

1050
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,601
Of course I'll will.
With my what?

1051
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,352
I said with your life.

1052
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,437
Anything you say, Holmes.

1053
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,605
There's no entrance
to this cellar

1054
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,983
except through that doorway.

1055
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,611
But, Holmes what I feel--
Oh.

1056
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,154
Brunton's murderer's
in this house

1057
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,780
and he's bound to make one last
effort to get down there

1058
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,574
- to erase those marks.
- Naturally.

1059
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,075
Lestrade's men
are posted outside

1060
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,577
and they'll see to it that
nobody leaves this house.

1061
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,120
Concentration camp.

1062
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,289
My men have orders to shoot
if necessary.

1063
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,124
- I'll be outside myself
keeping watch.
- Good.

1064
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,335
Sexton your post will be
at Miss Sally's door

1065
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,503
and remember she's in more
danger than anyone here.

1066
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,547
- Don't worry I'll look after
her, Mr. Holmes.
- Good night.

1067
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,257
- Good night, Holmes.
- Good nigh.

1068
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,302
Oh, Dr. Watson,
if you want any help, sing out.

1069
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,638
I don't mind saying I feel a
lot safer if I had a gun on me.

1070
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,224
Huh, I always
keep mine ready.

1071
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,149
Well, good night, Bob.
Keep awake, old man.

1072
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,817
I will.

1073
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,131
That's funny.
It's striking twelve again.

1074
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,656
Let me out of here,
you hear?

1075
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,119
Let me out of here.

1076
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,288
Someone locked this door.

1077
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,421
What on earth's
all this monkey business.

1078
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,422
I didn't lock you in.

1079
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,715
Well doors don't
lock themselves.

1080
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,883
They do in this house.

1081
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,176
What are you doing
down here anyway?

1082
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,136
- I'm worried about Langford.
- Langford?

1083
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,930
Yes, he's got into his head
that this is a Jap prison camp.

1084
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,432
He's got that filthy rope

1085
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,892
and he's bound and determined
to go out the window.

1086
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,436
He can't do that.
Lestrade's men will shoot him.

1087
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,188
He may be out already.

1088
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,814
I'll head him off.

1089
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,399
Then again he may not be.

1090
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,400
Perhaps you're right.

1091
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,693
Let me go.

1092
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,612
No, no.
You'll be shot.

1093
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,738
I'll go.

1094
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,864
No, you'll be shot.

1095
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,115
Oh really?

1096
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,076
Let's both go.

1097
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,995
I can't leave here.

1098
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,330
You stay where you are.

1099
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,415
I'll go and call Lestrade.

1100
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,089
Remember Clavering,
stay where you are.

1101
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,223
Here.

1102
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,558
Look here, Constable.
I'm Dr. Watson.

1103
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,477
Are you now?

1104
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,855
Well, I'm Mrs. Minivar.

1105
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,358
- Come along to the inspector.
- Gross impertinence.

1106
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,050
Useless.

1107
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,428
Quite useless,
I assure you.

1108
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,559
There's nothing written
on the floor.

1109
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,854
It was just a rouse of mine to
bring Brunton's murderer here.

1110
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,355
Permit me.

1111
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,107
As the most ruthless
killer in England

1112
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,525
you deserve some of the light.

1113
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,318
Killer, I?

1114
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,946
Oh I say,
you seem to forget that my
life was also attempted.

1115
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,032
And a very neat trick it was to
divert suspicion from yourself

1116
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,869
but it struck me as odd
that the man who murdered
both Musgraves

1117
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,537
with such a sure hand

1118
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,207
should have missed so badly
in your case

1119
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,919
unless of course, um,
you yourself were the murderer.

1120
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,088
Ah, that's ridiculous.

1121
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:53,635
Then too it seemed curious
that you a doctor

1122
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,929
examining both bodies

1123
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,765
and failed to report
the real cause of death.

1124
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,392
And that was?

1125
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,769
A cisternal needle
thrust up into the brain

1126
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,189
between the base of the skull
and the cervical vertebrae.

1127
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,900
I had the unpleasant duty of
removing this piece of a needle

1128
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,527
from Phillip Musgrave's head.

1129
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,946
It couldn't be yours
by any chance, could it?

1130
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,156
I never owned one.

1131
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,116
Oh yes, you did.

1132
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,328
I saw it in your case

1133
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,914
the night I came
into this house

1134
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,709
just after Geoffrey Musgrave
was found murdered.

1135
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,711
It wasn't broken then.

1136
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,296
It was only when you killed
Phillip Musgrave

1137
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,589
that you lost a piece of it.

1138
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,090
Nonsense.

1139
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,592
Why should I go around
sticking needles into people?

1140
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,677
A fair enough question,
doctor.

1141
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,095
Among nice people

1142
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,140
murder like matrimony
generally has a motive

1143
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,935
and in this case
the motive was matrimony.

1144
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,478
Oh, you mean Miss Sally?

1145
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,729
I do.

1146
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,689
Oh, I see,

1147
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,608
- so you think it's a case of
murder for profit, do you.
- Precisely.

1148
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,443
My dear, Holmes.
That won't do.

1149
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,695
The Musgraves are land poor.
Everybody knows that.

1150
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,947
Exactly.

1151
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,574
But everybody didn't know
what you knew.

1152
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,078
You worked out the meaning
of the Musgrave ritual.

1153
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,996
I have? Oh.

1154
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,041
Yes.
You have.

1155
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,169
You claimed you knew nothing
about the game of chess.

1156
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,880
When I suggested you'd moved
off your proper square

1157
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,007
you promptly named
king's bishop three

1158
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,717
and what's more
moved back onto it.

1159
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,344
Oh, nonsense.

1160
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,428
Why shouldn't I have stepped
out of my square in the first--

1161
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,013
Break up my moves,
spoil my game

1162
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,975
and protect me from finding
what you had already found.

1163
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,184
And that was?

1164
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,104
The old land grant
I took from this box

1165
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,148
which would have made
Sally Musgrave upon the
death of her brothers,

1166
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,359
the richest woman in England.

1167
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,446
Now what's that?

1168
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:40,617
Don't tell me you found
another needle?

1169
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:45,163
No, no.
It's just a button.

1170
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,748
It wouldn't be yours,
would it?

1171
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,042
Mine?

1172
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,502
Give it to me.

1173
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,470
Thank you.

1174
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,680
Would you mind
telling me why

1175
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,889
you think I was down here
with Brunton?

1176
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,600
No, not at all.

1177
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:08,270
As I see it you killed Phillip
Musgrave in his own room,

1178
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,731
carried his body down through
the secret passageway,

1179
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,649
out through the greenhouse
into the garage

1180
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,444
where you crammed it into the
rumble seat of that roadster

1181
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,821
but unfortunately for you,

1182
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,157
you had a witness.

1183
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:24,911
Brunton was there,
sleeping off his drunk.

1184
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,789
Nursing a grudge
against Phillip Musgrave.

1185
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,542
Brunton became your accessory.

1186
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,252
But you didn't want
an accessory

1187
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,172
so you lured him down here
with a promise

1188
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,549
to share the Musgrave
treasure with him

1189
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:42,262
and exit Brunton.

1190
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,056
Very ingenious, Mr. Holmes.

1191
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,807
You seem to have everything

1192
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,477
except perhaps the
negligible item of proof.

1193
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,354
Suppose we leave that
to the jury.

1194
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,272
Suppose we do.

1195
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,357
Shall we go?

1196
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,901
After you.

1197
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,444
Oh, by the way,

1198
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,072
don't forget your torch.

1199
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,823
Oh, thanks.

1200
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,703
I don't suppose
it occurred to you

1201
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,246
that you were taking
a bit of a chance

1202
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:12,125
coming down here all alone
with a suspected murderer.

1203
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:14,211
One has to take chances
in my profession, doctor.

1204
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,879
You see,
I couldn't possibly risk

1205
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,839
sharing my little
plot with anybody.

1206
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,466
Not even with Dr. Watson?

1207
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,218
Particularly not with
Dr. Watson.

1208
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,552
If he'd known
what was up tonight

1209
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,720
he could have been so
elaborate and mysterious

1210
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,180
he'd a given
the whole show away.

1211
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,723
As a matter of fact
I had a devil's own time

1212
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,475
luring him away
from that door upstairs

1213
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,228
so that we could be alone.

1214
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,896
That's all I wanted to know.

1215
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,483
Stay where you are.

1216
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,319
I'm afraid I have no choice,
Dr. Sexton.

1217
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,324
Look here.

1218
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,953
You're not really
gonna kill me, are you?

1219
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,081
- They'll hear you.
- Who will?

1220
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,541
That was a bad slip you made

1221
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:38,170
letting me know you were
so completely alone.

1222
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,547
And you're really
gonna kill me?

1223
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:46,178
I'm afraid I have no choice,
Mr. Holmes.

1224
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,555
As you said,

1225
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,766
I have no evidence against you.

1226
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,559
No proof.
No proof at all.

1227
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,979
You forget the needle
and the button.

1228
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,732
Bring them here, please.

1229
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:13,872
Not too close.

1230
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,333
Now put them in my pocket.

1231
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,797
Thank you.

1232
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,715
Curious about that button.

1233
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,134
It is off my coat, of course.

1234
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,929
I can't think how
I ever missed it.

1235
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,472
Poor old Brunton.

1236
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,557
He didn't struggle much.

1237
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,851
Now Phillip Musgrave
was different.

1238
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,480
The needle broke off and I didn't
have time to probe for it.

1239
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,148
But you have both
of them now,

1240
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,818
the button and the needle,
why kill me?

1241
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:48,615
Now step back just a bit.

1242
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:53,203
Against the wall.

1243
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,539
Now if you stand
perfectly still

1244
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,000
I think I can manage this
with one shot.

1245
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,986
Put 'em up.

1246
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,947
Did you hear his
confession, Watson.

1247
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,615
Every word, Holmes.

1248
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,826
And I heard all the rest, sir.

1249
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,244
Good.

1250
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,288
Let me congratulate you
on an extraordinary catch.

1251
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,623
That's right, Mr. Holmes.
It's no good saying it ain't.

1252
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,625
I'm afraid I
underestimated you, Holmes.

1253
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:41,459
Pity.

1254
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,295
Yes.

1255
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,006
Those blank cartridges were a
cheap sort of trick. I grant you.

1256
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,133
But it wasn't easy to let you
take my gun away from me

1257
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,302
without seeming to
hand it to you.

1258
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,053
That's why I let you take
the torch first.

1259
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,430
I knew you'd snap it off.

1260
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,807
Yes. We told you,
you were taking an awful risk.

1261
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,059
Well we had to have
a confession

1262
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,020
and these egomaniacs are
always so much more chatty

1263
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,605
when they feel
they have the upper hand.

1264
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,023
Shall we go?

1265
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,986
I can't make head nor
tail of it. Can you Pat?

1266
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:11,197
It looks like an
old land grant.

1267
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,782
It's really a crown grant.

1268
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,117
What I don't understand is

1269
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,661
why the Musgraves didn't
claim the land ages ago.

1270
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,246
Obviously Watson,
one of 'em died

1271
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,082
before passing on the meaning
of the ritual to his heir.

1272
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,959
The words remain
but the sense was lost.

1273
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,420
I wonder why he left the grant
down there where he found it.

1274
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,922
What good would it have
done him

1275
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,590
so long as your brothers lived.

1276
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,425
Once they were out of the way
and you came into the property

1277
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,968
he expected to marry you.

1278
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,845
I like that.

1279
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,889
- Whatever made him think that
- He thought himself
irresistible.

1280
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,182
Precisely.

1281
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,892
It's not unheard of
in cases of egomania.

1282
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,852
I suppose then he meant to
rediscover the crown grant.

1283
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,354
At the proper time, yes

1284
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,356
and then enjoy
his wife's millions.

1285
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,191
- Did you say millions?
- I did.

1286
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,817
Look here.

1287
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,283
About eighty thousand acres
of the richest soil in England.

1288
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,576
But aren't there people on it?

1289
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,412
Yes, farms, villages,
even a factory town

1290
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,789
with hundreds of
workman's cottages.

1291
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,248
- Is this thing legal?
- Perfectly.

1292
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,708
Of course it'll drag
on through the courts.

1293
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,168
Just a moment.

1294
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,795
The people on this land,

1295
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,714
they put their money into it,
their life work.

1296
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,550
- It's their homes
I'll be taking.
- Yes.

1297
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,553
Do you think I'm going
to kick these people out?

1298
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,236
Just the same, Holmes

1299
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,904
you let poor little Sally
throw away a fortune.

1300
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,115
My dear fellow,
I had nothing to do with it.

1301
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,283
The girl, more power to her,
acted on her own.

1302
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,121
It was a grand gesture
one she may regret.

1303
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:44,082
I don't think so, Watson.

1304
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,252
There's a new spirit
abroad in the land.

1305
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,714
The old days of grab and greed
are on their way out.

1306
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,216
We're beginning to think of
what we owe the other fellow

1307
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,052
not just what we're
compelled to give him.

1308
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,263
The time is coming, Watson,

1309
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,181
when we shan't be able
to fill our bellies in comfort

1310
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,933
while other folk go hungry

1311
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,269
or sleep in warm beds

1312
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:07,063
while others shiver in the cold

1313
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,648
and we shan't be able to kneel

1314
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:12,193
and thank God for blessing us
before our shining alters

1315
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,279
while men anywhere

1316
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,907
are kneeling
in either physical or
a spiritual subjection.

1317
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,953
You may be right, Holmes.
I hope you are.

1318
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:28,334
And god willing we'll live
to see that day, Watson.
