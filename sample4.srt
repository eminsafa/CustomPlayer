1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,378
<i>(man) Previously on "Prison Break":</i>

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,504
I didn't kill him.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,882
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,677
<i>Put down your weapon.</i>

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,513
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a cell.

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,392
<i>- I'm looking for Burrows.
- (Sucre) Man killed the VP's brother.</i>

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,020
- Why do you want to see him?
- He's my brother.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,272
- I'm getting you out.
- Impossible.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,941
Not if you designed the place.

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,860
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better.

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,820
I've got 'em on me.

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,698
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,033
The evidence was cooked.

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:38,080
- There's a lawyer poking around.
- Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

15
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:43,752
- I'm gonna kill that scum.
- You kill him, you kill our ticket out of here.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,213
- Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me now.

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,382
Fish, I gotta be back in.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:54,054
Nick, Project Justice. My boss may not think
Lincoln's case is worth looking into, but I do.

19
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,555
When do we get started?

20
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,683
This wall is just the beginning.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,186
There's a lot of real estate
in between here and the outside.

22
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:06,942
That is a transfer request. Michael Scofield
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

23
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:44,229
- About your transfer request for Scofield.
- More specifically, why you denied it.

24
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:49,109
Look, Mr Kellerman, do I come to your house
and tell you where to put your furniture?

25
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:54,489
- We're just asking for professional courtesy.
- A federal courtesy in a state penitentiary.

26
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,993
Most people would be happy
to have a body taken off their hands.

27
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,580
These men are my responsibility.
From the minute they walk in

28
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,417
to the time they've paid their debt to society,
I'm responsible.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,295
Unless he's done something
I don't know about,

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,048
he is gonna stay here at Fox River
under my watch.

31
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,094
Mr Pope, in our line of work,
just about everyone has done something

32
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,389
that someone doesn't know about.

33
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,477
- What's this?
- Right now, just a piece of history.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,647
Whether it becomes a current event,
now, that's up to you.

35
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,988
My wife already knows about Toledo.

36
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,491
Does she really?

37
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,499
You're a smart man, Warden.

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,669
I'm sure you can find a reason
Scofield's presence is no longer required

39
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,547
at this particular correctional facility.

40
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,355
I need some more PVC here, boss.

41
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,869
- Boss?
- Sure thing, Burrows.

42
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,706
I don't wanna check for splinters.
I want every piece accounted for.

43
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,000
Sure.

44
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,045
I got a ripped fertilizer bag inside.

45
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,091
Hey, you!

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,385
You!

47
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:44,432
Get in there and clean it up before this whole
place starts smelling like San Juan.

48
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,559
<i>(mutters to himself)</i>

49
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:52,482
OK, he's on his way. Do you mind telling me
what this is all about?

50
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,612
These are the guys we're breaking out with.

51
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:01,700
I don't think so, fish.
That was not our agreement.

52
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,662
I'm not gonna work with this crazy rhino.

53
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,374
- Keep pushing it, John.
- Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

54
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,584
What's your deal, man?

55
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,963
Touch my brother again and I'll show you.

56
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,969
Brother? Your brother?

57
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:30,979
We've got a few minutes. Are we gonna spend
'em spitting on each other or talk business?

58
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,357
The reason we're all here today
is we have a decision to make.

59
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,818
English, Fitz, or Percy.

60
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:42,323
If we're gonna pull this off,
we need to take one of them out.

61
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,035
And you want us to tell you which one?

62
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,371
I just want you to help me get to them.
I'll take it from there.

63
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,790
- You're crazy.
- All I need is five minutes.

64
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,794
- You won't get five seconds.
- I thought you had everything worked out.

65
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:59,758
We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice.
It's gonna take more than digging a few holes.

66
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:04,012
There are eyes, ears, dots that couldn't be
connected from the outside.

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,391
- And English, Fitz or Percy?
- One of those dots.

68
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:14,397
And how exactly
are you supposed to pull this off?

69
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,692
With a little help from my friends.

70
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,171
Sucre, hold up. Scofield, you've got company.

71
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:53,770
Why do I get the feeling that there's more
to you than meets the eye, Scofield?

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,439
Anything you wanna tell me?

73
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:03,196
Some other reason you're in here
besides holding up a bank?

74
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,377
- You're being transferred.
- What?

75
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,046
We're moving you over to Statesville.

76
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,550
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can. I'm the boss here.

77
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,886
This is my house.

78
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,097
- Three weeks.
- What for?

79
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,393
Lincoln Burrows.
He's being executed in three weeks.

80
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,563
I'm aware of that. What's that to you?

81
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,148
He's my brother.

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,654
When I knew I was being sent to prison,
my attorney petitioned the DOC.

83
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,907
- So you could be near him.
- That's right.

84
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,413
Don't take that away from me.

85
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,790
Not until it's over.

86
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm not the one behind the transfer.

87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,839
You're up against much bigger fish than me.

88
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,637
I'll arrange for you to say goodbye.
You ship out tomorrow.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,584
<i>(faint organ music)</i>

90
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,393
I'm going into the walls,
see if I can access the roof.

91
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,104
Were you gonna tell me about the transfer?

92
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,650
- I'm taking care of it.
- You're taking care of it?

93
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,110
Sounds to me like you're reaching.

94
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,155
Maybe. A little.

95
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,449
A little.

96
00:08:53,533 --> 00:09:00,081
I'd made my peace, then you give me the one
thing a man in my situation shouldn't have.

97
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,835
- Hope. And now that's gonna be taken away.
- Don't do this, Linc.

98
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,713
I got three weeks.
What do you want me to do?

99
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>(boy) Come on, Michael.
What do you want me to do?</i>

100
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,644
- Bring her back.
- You know I can't do that.

101
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,190
But, look, there's some stuff that I can do.

102
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,569
It's not gonna be the same,
but we're gonna figure it out.

103
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:33,489
And no matter what,
it's still gonna be me and you.

104
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,369
OK, but what if something happens to you?

105
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,914
You just have a little faith.

106
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,592
Just have a little faith.

107
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,848
<i>(Nick) If we believe Lincoln, this tape is a lie.</i>

108
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,310
- It has to be.
- But you saw it. It's all there.

109
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,397
But maybe what we're looking for
is what's not there.

110
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,986
- OK. Steadman. See, what's he looking at?
- A car? A pedestrian?

111
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,364
<i>(Nick) His eye line is high.
He's looking into the camera.</i>

112
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,616
He might as well be saying "cheese".

113
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,913
- Now he just sits there.
- For 10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

114
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,167
- Waiting for someone.
- Right.

115
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,671
There. That's a nine millimetre.
Shouldn't there be a kick?

116
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,759
- Lincoln's pretty strong.
- Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?

117
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,512
Now, you shoot someone,
supposedly for revenge.

118
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,975
Do you take the time to go in and hit
the glove box? Or get the hell out of there?

119
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,688
Feds said he was trying
to make it look like a robbery.

120
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,567
Look. Look at Lincoln's angle
as he leaves the frame.

121
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,027
Mm.

122
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,780
He walks away from the car.

123
00:10:55,863 --> 00:11:01,410
Now, this guy, who conveniently hides his
face from the camera, comes back in. Why?

124
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:07,583
To explain the bloody pants they'd already
planted in his apartment. Nick, this is great.

125
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,086
- Who shall we go to?
- Nobody. Yet.

126
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,799
To the unbiased eye, we're backing a horse
that died in the gate. A lot of conjecture.

127
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,760
We don't have anything.
We need some evidence.

128
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,221
Look, if Lincoln didn't fire this gun,

129
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,641
somebody with serious skills
worked on this to prove he did.

130
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,310
Fine, but how do we prove that?

131
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:30,439
- I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

132
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,566
Yeah, I know a guy.

133
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,653
Thanks.

134
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,782
We need to have a powwow. There's been talk
about you packing your bags.

135
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,620
Don't believe everything you hear.
I'm not going anywhere.

136
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,167
I have a really hard time trusting you, fish.

137
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,420
The important thing
is that we stay on schedule.

138
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,966
- Yeah? English, Fitz and Percy?
- English, Fitz or Percy.

139
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,260
Wanna know which one we should take out?

140
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,347
With all due respect, I don't need opinions.
I need answers.

141
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,476
The warden leaves at five tonight,
so by five after five we need that key.

142
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,563
And how is this key
gonna give you the answers?

143
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,607
I'll worry about that.
Worry about getting the key.

144
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,444
Hey. This key better be worth it.

145
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,155
Understand?

146
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,747
Afternoon, Mr Scofield.

147
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,792
I need to know
if there's a way to block a transfer.

148
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:36,046
- There's about 50 ways.
- All right. I'll take the quickest.

149
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,217
You file a motion for what they call
an interlocutory injunction.

150
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,095
- How long does that take?
- How fast can you write?

151
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:47,349
A man can claim almost anything
violates his constitutional rights.

152
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:52,062
Environmental issues, allergies,
religious requirements - take your pick.

153
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,816
- What if they don't buy it?
- They're required to hear your motion.

154
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,235
Till they do, you can't be transferred.

155
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,948
Hell, they've been trying to move
my tired, grey behind for ten years.

156
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,619
God bless the American legal system.

157
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,455
Why do you want to stay in here so badly?

158
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,375
There's someone here
I can't bear to leave behind.

159
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,880
I guess that means
we've got something in common.

160
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,259
- The state's requiring a physical for Burrows.
- You heard the news?

161
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,470
- No, what?
- They're brothers.

162
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,598
- Who?
- Burrows and Scofield.

163
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,891
Michael Scofield?

164
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:33,187
Heard it from one of the COs over in Gen Pop.
He didn't say anything about it?

165
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,521
No.

166
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:40,736
It must be hard to be so close to your brother
and not be able to do anything to help him.

167
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,120
- What's this?
- A little bathroom reading.

168
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:55,250
- Westmoreland again?
- Scofield. He's blocking his transfer.

169
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,882
Even if the motion is denied,
it's gonna take 30 days to process.

170
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,760
And that means...

171
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:09,056
All right, I'm going in.
I'm gonna need your help.

172
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,975
<i>In in? Now? I thought you were waiting till...</i>

173
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,188
I need to make sure I know how I'm getting
up there so when the time comes...

174
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:19,108
In case you didn't notice, the lights are all on.

175
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,862
You've got a live studio audience, fish.
How are you gonna get around that?

176
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,532
Don't we have some laundry to do?

177
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,455
Just to be clear,

178
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,874
I ain't touching your drawers.

179
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,221
<i>(guard #1) Eyes straight ahead.</i>

180
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:51,682
<i>- Keep it moving.
- (guard #2) Eyes front.</i>

181
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,727
<i>- (guard #1) Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
- Him.</i>

182
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,875
<i>(guard #1) Get him up. Hit him.</i>

183
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,879
<i>(guard #2) Stay down.</i>

184
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,214
Come on.

185
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,133
Come on.

186
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,407
Fish. I can't deal with that.

187
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,491
Fish. Come on.

188
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,135
Yo, fish. Fish, you're taking too long, bro.

189
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:05,584
This ain't gonna fly. The Ricans, we've got
genetically higher blood pressure, you know?

190
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,086
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

191
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,338
You said he was moving in on your girl.

192
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,466
My other cousin,
but thanks for bringing that up.

193
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,763
Look, the good news is I can get to the roof.

194
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,391
- So what happens now?
- Now?

195
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:24,144
It's all about timing.

196
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:27,147
<i>(watch beeps)</i>

197
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:01,598
- It's a top-dollarjob. You know who did it?
- No. Do you?

198
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:04,684
People who do this kind of work
are ghosts, man.

199
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,520
The guy behind the guy behind the guy,
you know?

200
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,608
Can you see anything that proves
the tape might have been doctored?

201
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,069
The thing's clean. No footprints.

202
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,656
Usually, you peel the video back,
anything bogus comes off.

203
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,492
Now you see it, now you don't.
But not this one.

204
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,954
It's laced. Ingrained.

205
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,915
Whoa, whoa.

206
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:30,543
- You see something?
- The problem with eyes is they play tricks.

207
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,880
But your ears - ears don't lie.

208
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:36,216
Here's the audio track from the tape.

209
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,135
- Sounds pretty true?
- Yeah.

210
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,181
But noise is alive.
See, it doesn'tjust die like that.

211
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:46,017
Stripped down,
those levels should be dancing.

212
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:50,647
A room that size would give you
a blam, blam, blam, blam, you know.

213
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,316
Off each wall, a split second after the other.

214
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,903
On yours,
the reverb's bouncing at the same time.

215
00:19:56,986 --> 00:20:00,323
- What does that mean?
- The sound of a gunshot.

216
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,326
It wasn't recorded in that room.

217
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,166
- Would you testify to that?
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

218
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,461
The tape's a dupe.
For all I know, you guys tampered with it.

219
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:20,009
Look, if you want me to testify in court, I'm
gonna need to get my hands on the original.

220
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:26,724
<i>- (Pope) How are those allergies?
- Excuse me?</i>

221
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:31,312
<i>- (Pope) In your motion, you cited chronic...
- Sinusitis.</i>

222
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,233
It's not an allergy, actually.
It's a bacterial infection.

223
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:40,155
The moist air from the river along
the east wall helps keep me, you know...

224
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,031
clear.

225
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,161
I'm impressed. Not even a week here
and you're working it like an old con.

226
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:49,956
You've got one up on me.
You know why I needed to file those motions,

227
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,418
but I have no idea
why you needed to transfer me.

228
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,338
Traffic control, Scofield.
That's all. Traffic control.

229
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,133
It's coming up on five o'clock. Call it a day.

230
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,510
- I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?

231
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,763
If I let go of this support,
the whole thing's coming down.

232
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,516
See, the Taj was designed using axial force -

233
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,395
a series of internal forces
along the longitudinal axis.

234
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:16,983
- Yeah. How much longer?
- Depends on how long it takes to dry.

235
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,778
If you need me to leave,
I can show your secretary how to hold it.

236
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,323
You can stay. There'll be a guard outside.

237
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:27,243
Just check in with Becky
and she'll have somebody escort you back.

238
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,371
- All right.
- And, Scofield.

239
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:36,711
I wanna thank you for showing up today.
I would've understood it if you didn't.

240
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:39,214
- We had a deal.
- Right.

241
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,592
Still, thanks. My wife is gonna love it.

242
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,928
You're welcome.

243
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:59,567
<i>- (man) See you tomorrow, sir.
- (woman) Good night, Warden.</i>

244
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,819
<i>(door closes)</i>

245
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,698
We'd just happen to be two people
who happen to know each other,

246
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:10,495
who happen to show up at the same movie
theatre at what happens to be the same time.

247
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:13,206
<i>(woman laughs)</i>

248
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:55,873
You know, from this angle, you look
just as good as you did when we first met.

249
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,377
- How about from this one?
- Even better.

250
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,757
- Oh.
- Uh-uh. Those are for your guests.

251
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,926
- Guests?
- Your associates.

252
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:10,847
They said you had a meeting.
They're in the den.

253
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,857
Evening, Warden.

254
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:12,366
There's nothing I can do. I'm obligated to file
every motion so a hearing can be scheduled.

255
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,997
- And how long does that take?
- A month, maybe two. It's out of my hands.

256
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,541
Why do I feel you're not disappointed?

257
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,045
May I ask you a question, Warden?

258
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,380
More of an observation, really.

259
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:31,844
I was looking at the morgue photos
from that boy back in Toledo - Will Clayton -

260
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:36,682
and, my Lord,
if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy.

261
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:41,520
The apple fell real far from the tree
with that one, didn't it?

262
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:45,441
It fell off the tree, fell all over the pavement.

263
00:24:45,524 --> 00:24:47,693
You son of a bitch.

264
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,571
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair,

265
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,491
but that's all the forgiveness she's got left.

266
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:56,661
Especially when it comes to
an illegitimate child.

267
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:59,372
What happened with young Will, Warden?

268
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:05,127
- Get out of my house.
- Lose Scofield's paperwork.

269
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,757
- Are you staying for dinner?
- Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

270
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,385
Judy, it was a real pleasure.

271
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:17,306
Thank you. And thatjust may have been
the best iced tea I've ever had.

272
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,018
Warden, better do everything you can
to hold on to this one.

273
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,771
- I will.
- Good.

274
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,946
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah. Just fine. I, uh...

275
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,534
I just have a little unfinished work
to take care of. I'll be right in.

276
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:38,494
OK.

277
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,492
He's all clear.

278
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,662
- Evening, Lincoln.
- Doctor.

279
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,082
I'm supposed to give you
a physical this evening.

280
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,211
Let me apologise for the dose of irony
we're about to participate in.

281
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:32,089
It's all right. Just doing yourjob.

282
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,507
Yeah, well...

283
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:39,513
Letting them know you're healthy enough to
execute is not why I went to medical school.

284
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,224
- I apologise.
- It's OK.

285
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,397
All right.

286
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,525
I'm gonna need
a family medical history from you.

287
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,864
Any ailments or conditions
that are hereditary. Let's start with your mom.

288
00:26:56,947 --> 00:27:00,367
- Cancer. Liver.
- OK. Father?

289
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,871
Split when I was young.

290
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:06,123
Siblings.

291
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,918
Anyone besides Michael?

292
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,506
Fox River's a small town, Lincoln.

293
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:18,344
People around here don't have
a whole lot to do besides time and talk.

294
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,305
Are you close?

295
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,558
<i>(Linc) We were.</i>

296
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,355
<i>- (Sara) How about now?
- Huh?</i>

297
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:31,857
How about now?

298
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:37,112
<i>(Linc) He's been abandoned his whole life.</i>

<i>Dad, Mom - she died young -</i>

300
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:44,745
<i>and now me.</i>

301
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,831
Think that's why he's here?

302
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:51,919
Cos your death would feel like
it's happening again

303
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:58,842
<i>(Linc) I abandoned him a long time ago.
That's why he's here.</i>

304
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:24,451
<i>- (watch beeps)

00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:32,209
- It's time.
- Time?

307
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:36,213
Oh, God. Here we go again.
Count's in 15 minutes. What are you doing?

308
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:40,926
- Trust me. The less you know, the better.
- The less I know? You got me in the dark.

309
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,595
That's exactly where you wanna be.

310
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,730
<i>(man) Don't normally find you here
at this hour.</i>

311
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:57,526
Are you seeking his forgiveness? Or advice?

312
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:02,072
I really don't know any more, Ben.

313
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:08,037
All I know is my son Will
was my responsibility.

314
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:15,210
- If I'd stayed in his life, I could've saved it.
- His death was an accident, Henry.

315
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,466
He was a criminal,

316
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:25,095
and an addict, but he was only 18 years old.

317
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:29,975
His mother made it clear you couldn't be
in his life if you weren't gonna be in hers.

318
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,771
When you chose to stay with Judy,
you understood that.

319
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:36,774
I not only understood it, I was grateful for it.

320
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:42,154
I told myself I was respecting her wishes.

321
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:47,910
I cursed her under my breath
while every day I thanked God

322
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:51,038
for allowing me to wash my hands of her.

323
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,290
Of Toledo.

324
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,461
All of it.

325
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,590
So I ran home,

326
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:04,301
to Judy,

327
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:06,970
and I buried the secret.

328
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:12,184
But I never got a chance to...

329
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:15,729
to bury my... my son.

330
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:30,994
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

331
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:36,750
Sacrifices somebody else's life
just to make their own life easier.

332
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:43,757
You can argue with me all night. Believe me,
I haven't got anything better to do.

333
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,304
But it won't change the fact that I can't
just hand out original copies of evidence.

334
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:54,142
- If you could just take a look...
- I don't care. I can't give it to you.

335
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:58,272
What if we brought somebody here?
Your supervisor could monitor them.

336
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,483
He'd strip down and swear
on a stack of Bibles. Whatever.

337
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,653
Wait. What did you say
the docket number was?

338
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:08,740
It's 296 SPE.

339
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:12,035
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

340
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:21,044
Last night a pipe burst upstairs,
flooded the place.

341
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:26,675
Files from over 100 cases -
pretty much lost all of them, including yours.

342
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:30,178
- Just this room?
- Some kind of freak accident.

00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:11,775

- Still locked. I checked.

How the hell did he?

367
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:17,238
- What's going on?
- You're in the warden's office.

368
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,034
I could kill you and the paperwork
wouldn't need more than a date.

369
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:25,872
- Tell me, what were you doing in here?
- All right, Deputy. That's enough.

370
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:31,294
The work wasn't dry.
You said to stay until it was.

371
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:33,296
- You were in here?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:36,633
- It's true. I never saw him leave.
- I must not have seen him.

373
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:41,054
This is ridiculous. This prisoner
was out of his cell. He missed the count.

<i>(Pope) I understand, Deputy.</i>

375

The thing is,
Mr Scofield is not our problem any more.

376
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:50,605
There was an error in his paperwork.
He's gonna be transferred.

377
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:52,899
That's not possible.

378
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:55,610
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

379
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:57,278
Warden, all I need is three weeks.

380
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,823
- Get off me!
- Come on!

381
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:02,909
Henry, please. I just need a little time.

382
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:05,495
Just give me the time.

383
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:10,834
Any chance you want to write this off
as a coincidence?

384
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:12,293
Me neither.

385
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:16,256
How could they know we were coming?
Three hours ago, we didn't know.

386
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:20,218
- We're pissing someone off.
- You say that like it's a good thing.

387
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:25,390
People start breaking the law,
you know you're getting warm.

388
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:30,228
We still have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

389
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:36,317
- Nick.
- Stay here.

390
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,754
Whoever it was has gone.
Does it look like they got anything?

391
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:59,215
No.

392
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:07,891
Everything's exactly the way I left it.

393
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,526
What? What?

394
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:23,573
- What?
- The tape. It's gone.

395
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:25,366
- Are you sure?
- How?

396
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,910
- Think this through.
- How could they know?

397
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:30,246
- Wait. Does anyone else have a key?
- No.

398
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,334
- Are you sure this is where you put it?
- You were here. I was talking to you.

399
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,379
I walked toward the cabinet, and I said...

400
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,633
What?

401
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:45,053

00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:52,560

I'm sure your ride'll be along any minute now.

410
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:32,016
We were gonna take Fitz out.

411
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:35,728
It was as clear as day.

412
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:43,069
And the cops? How long did it take them
to respond? You got all the timing down?

413
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:48,658
